In real life, this can be seen in effective teamwork where all members listen to each other to achieve a common goal.</li>        <li><strong>Na indro arvāg idaṁ vacaḥ:</strong> This means "Let not Indra (the king of gods) be far from this speech."

Soma is a sacred drink in Vedic tradition, symbolizing nourishment and vitality. In modern contexts, this can be likened to the pursuit of knowledge and experiences that enrich our lives, such as education or cultural experiences that enhance personal growth.</li>        <li><strong>Dhiyā śaviṣṭha ā gamat:</strong> This translates to "May the best thoughts come to us." It emphasizes the importance of wisdom and clarity in thought.
