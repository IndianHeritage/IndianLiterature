        <ul>    <li><strong>Tripād ūrdhva ud ait puruṣaḥ:</strong> This phrase translates to "Three quarters of the Purusha (cosmic being) ascended." Here, "Purusha" represents the universal spirit or consciousness, and "tripād" signifies the three-quarters of this essence that transcends the physical realm.</li>    <li><strong>Pādo 'syehābhavat punaḥ:</strong> This means "One quarter of it became the physical form." It indicates that while the majority of the Purusha exists in a higher state, a part of it manifests in the material world, suggesting a connection between the spiritual and physical realms.</li>    <li><strong>Tato viṣvaṅ vy akrāmat:</strong> This translates to "From that, the entire universe emerged." It emphasizes the idea that the cosmos and all living beings are derived from this singular cosmic entity, reinforcing the interconnectedness of all existence.</li>    <li><strong>Sāśanānaśane abhi:</strong> This means "With the eternal and the transient." It highlights the duality of existence, where the eternal (spiritual) and the transient (material) coexist and interact.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> Consider the concept of a tree. The roots (representing the spiritual aspect) are hidden beneath the ground, while the trunk and branches (the physical manifestation) are visible. Just as the tree relies on both its roots and its branches for survival, humans too are a blend of spiritual essence and physical form.</li>    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This mantra encapsulates the essence of creation and existence, illustrating the relationship between the spiritual and material worlds. It serves as a reminder that while we navigate our physical lives, we are also part of a greater cosmic reality.</li>    <li><strong>Application in Real Life:</strong> In daily life, this mantra encourages individuals to seek balance between their spiritual pursuits and material responsibilities. For instance, a person may engage in meditation (spiritual practice) while also fulfilling their duties at work (material existence), recognizing that both aspects are essential for holistic living.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra signifies the unity of the spiritual and physical realms, urging individuals to acknowledge their dual nature. By understanding this interconnectedness, one can strive for a balanced life that honors both the eternal and the transient, leading to a more fulfilling existence.</li></ul>
