Vritra symbolizes obstacles or challenges. This can be interpreted as the triumph of good over evil or the overcoming of difficulties.

It suggests the importance of balance between tradition and innovation. In modern society, this can be applied to businesses that respect traditional values while also embracing new technologies and ideas to stay relevant and competitive.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra encapsulates the essence of overcoming challenges, the pursuit of knowledge, and the balance between tradition and innovation.
