        <ul>    <li><strong>yajño devānām praty eti sumnam</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "the sacrifice (yajña) approaches the gods (devānām) with auspiciousness (sumnam)." In real life, this can be understood as the importance of offering our actions and intentions to a higher purpose or divine entity. For example, when we engage in charitable acts or community service, we are essentially performing a yajña, dedicating our efforts to the welfare of others and invoking positive energies.</li>        <li><strong>ādityāso bhavatā mṛḻayantaḥ</strong>: This translates to "may the Adityas (the solar deities) bring us prosperity (mṛḻayantaḥ)." The Adityas are often associated with health, wealth, and vitality. In a modern context, this can be related to seeking guidance and blessings from nature or the universe for our endeavors. For instance, when starting a new business, many people perform rituals or seek blessings to ensure success and prosperity.</li>        <li><strong>ā vo 'rvācī sumatir vavṛtyād</strong>: This means "may your intellect (sumatir) be directed towards the right path (rvācī)." This emphasizes the importance of wisdom and discernment in our decisions. In everyday life, this can be seen in the choices we make regarding our careers, relationships, and personal growth. For example, when faced with a difficult decision, seeking advice from mentors or reflecting on our values can help us align with the right path.</li>        <li><strong>aṁhoś cid yā varivovittarāsat</strong>: This can be interpreted as "may the knowledge (cid) that is vast (varivovittarāsat) be with us." This highlights the significance of knowledge and learning in our lives. In a practical sense, this can relate to the pursuit of education and continuous self-improvement. For instance, lifelong learning through courses, reading, or workshops can enrich our lives and empower us to contribute positively to society.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra encapsulates the essence of performing selfless actions, seeking divine blessings, and pursuing wisdom. Its significance lies in the reminder that our actions should be directed towards the greater good, and that we should always strive for knowledge and understanding.
