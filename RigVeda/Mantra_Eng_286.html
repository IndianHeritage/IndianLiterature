        <ul>    <li><strong>darśaṁ nu viśvadarśataṁ</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "I see the universal vision." Here, "darśaṁ" refers to sight or vision, while "viśvadarśataṁ" implies a broader, universal perspective. In real life, this can be likened to the ability to see beyond one's immediate surroundings and understand the interconnectedness of all things. For example, a scientist studying climate change must look at global patterns rather than just local weather to grasp the full impact of their work.</li>        <li><strong>darśaṁ ratham adhi kṣami</strong>: This translates to "I see the chariot that I can control." The "ratham" symbolizes a chariot, which in many cultures represents the journey of life or the path one takes. "Adhi kṣami" suggests the ability to steer or control this journey. In practical terms, this can be related to personal agency and decision-making. For instance, a person navigating their career path must take control of their choices to reach their desired destination.</li>        <li><strong>etā juṣata me giraḥ</strong>: This means "Let my words be pleasing." "Etā" refers to these, "juṣata" means to be pleasing or agreeable, and "me giraḥ" translates to "my words." This emphasizes the importance of communication and the impact of our words on others. In everyday life, this can be seen in the way leaders inspire their teams or how friends support each other through kind words during difficult times.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra encapsulates a profound understanding of vision, control, and communication. It encourages individuals to seek a universal perspective, take charge of their life's journey, and communicate effectively. In real-life scenarios, this can be applied in various fields such as leadership, education, and personal development. By embracing these principles, one can foster a more harmonious and interconnected existence, ultimately leading to personal growth and societal well-being.</li></ul>
