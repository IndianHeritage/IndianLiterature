For example, in many cultures, long hair is associated with spiritual leaders or warriors, representing their commitment and power.</li>        <li><strong>harī vṛṣaṇā</strong>: "Harī" refers to the divine or the one who removes sins, while "vṛṣaṇā" can mean "the one who is strong" or "the bull."

This part of the mantra suggests a plea or a statement regarding the divine's role in our lives. In practical terms, it can be related to the idea that even the most powerful beings need support and sustenance, much like how individuals rely on community and resources to thrive.</li>        <li><strong>girām upaśrutiṁ cara</strong>: "Girām" means "of the voices" or "of the words," "upaśrutiṁ" refers to "the hearing" or "the understanding," and "cara" means "to move" or "to act."
