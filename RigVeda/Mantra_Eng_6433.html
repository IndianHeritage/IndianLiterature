        <ul>    <li><strong>viprasya vā stuvataḥ</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "of the wise, or those who praise." Here, "vipra" refers to a learned or wise person, often someone who possesses knowledge and insight. In real life, this can be likened to individuals who are respected in their communities for their wisdom, such as teachers, philosophers, or spiritual leaders.</li>        <li><strong>sahaso yaho makṣūtamasya rātiṣu</strong>: This part means "with great strength, may we attain the highest of desires." The term "sahasa" implies strength or power, while "makṣūtamasya" refers to the highest or best. This can be related to personal goals and aspirations in life, where individuals strive to achieve their utmost potential, whether in their careers, relationships, or personal development.</li>        <li><strong>avodevam uparimartyaṁ</strong>: This translates to "may we understand the divine that is beyond the mortal." It suggests a quest for higher knowledge or spiritual understanding that transcends ordinary human experience. In practical terms, this can be seen in the pursuit of spiritual practices, meditation, or philosophical inquiry that seeks to connect with something greater than oneself.</li>        <li><strong>kṛdhi vaso vividuṣo vacaḥ</strong>: This means "may we create a space for the wise to express their words." The word "kṛdhi" implies creation or making, while "vasa" refers to a dwelling or space. This can be interpreted as the importance of fostering environments where wisdom and knowledge can be shared, such as in educational institutions, community gatherings, or even online platforms where ideas can be exchanged freely.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra emphasizes the significance of wisdom, strength, and the pursuit of higher knowledge. It encourages individuals to seek out and create spaces for learning and sharing wisdom, both for personal growth and for the benefit of the community. In real-life scenarios, this can be applied in various contexts, such as educational settings, spiritual practices, and community engagement, where the collective pursuit of knowledge and understanding can lead to a more enlightened society.</p>
