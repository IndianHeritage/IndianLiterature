Here, "ajo" means eternal or unborn, and "tapasā" refers to the practice of austerity or spiritual discipline.

The term "arciḥ" signifies radiance or brilliance. In everyday life, this can be likened to the inspiration one receives from art, nature, or even acts of kindness, which can uplift and motivate individuals to pursue their goals.</li>        <li><strong>Yās te śivās tanvo jātavedas:</strong> This phrase can be understood as "those who are blessed with auspiciousness and knowledge." "Jātavedas" refers to the one who knows all births or the one who is aware of all creation. This can be related to the idea that individuals who seek knowledge and understanding are often more successful and fulfilled in their lives, as they are better equipped to navigate challenges.</li>        <li><strong>Tābhir vahainaṁ sukṛtām u lokam:</strong> This translates to "may you be carried to the realm of the virtuous." The term "sukṛtām" refers to the righteous or virtuous actions. In real life, this can be seen in how good deeds and ethical behavior can lead to a more harmonious and fulfilling life, as well as the idea that positive actions can create a ripple effect in society.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra emphasizes the importance of seeking inner wisdom, enlightenment, and virtuous living. It signifies that through self-discipline and the pursuit of knowledge, individuals can attain a higher state of being and contribute positively to the world around them. In real-life scenarios, this can be applied in various contexts, such as personal development, education, and community service, where the focus is on uplifting oneself and others through righteous actions and the pursuit of truth.</p>
