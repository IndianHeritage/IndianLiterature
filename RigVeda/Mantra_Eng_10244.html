        <ul>    <li><strong>tiraścīno vitato raśmir</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "the rays that are spread out horizontally." Here, "tiraścīno" refers to something that is horizontal or lateral, while "vitato" means spread out or extended. In real life, this can be likened to the rays of the sun that spread across the horizon at dawn, illuminating the world.</li>        <li><strong>eṣām adhaḥ svid āsīd upari svid āsīt</strong>: This translates to "where they are below and where they are above." This line emphasizes the duality of existence, suggesting that there are forces or elements both beneath us and above us. For example, in nature, we see the earth (below) and the sky (above), representing the balance of life.</li>        <li><strong>retodhā āsan mahimāna āsan</strong>: This can be interpreted as "the greatness that exists in the essence of creation." "Retodhā" refers to the essence or the creative force, while "mahimāna" signifies greatness. This can be related to the idea of potential within every individual or entity, where greatness is inherent but needs to be realized, much like a seed that has the potential to grow into a mighty tree.</li>        <li><strong>svadhā avastāt prayatiḥ parastāt</strong>: This translates to "the self that exists beyond effort." "Svadhā" refers to the self or one's own nature, while "avastāt" means to exist or to be present. "Prayatiḥ" refers to effort or striving, and "parastāt" means beyond. This can be seen in the context of personal growth, where sometimes the most profound changes occur when we stop forcing things and allow our true selves to emerge naturally.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This mantra from the Rigveda encapsulates the essence of existence, the balance of forces, and the inherent greatness within creation. It teaches us about the importance of recognizing both the visible and invisible aspects of life, the potential within ourselves, and the value of allowing our true nature to unfold without excessive effort. In real life, this can be applied in various scenarios such as personal development, understanding nature, and fostering a sense of balance in our lives. By embracing these teachings, we can cultivate a deeper awareness of our surroundings and ourselves, leading to a more harmonious existence.</li></ul>
