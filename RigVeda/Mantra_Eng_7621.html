        <ul>    <li><strong>śrāyanta iva sūryaṁ</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "like the sun shining." It signifies the brilliance and life-giving energy of the sun, which is essential for all living beings. In real life, we can relate this to the importance of sunlight for growth, health, and vitality, much like how the sun nourishes plants and provides warmth.</li>        <li><strong>viśved indrasya bhakṣata</strong>: This translates to "all beings partake of Indra." Indra is a significant deity in Vedic literature, often associated with rain, storms, and the heavens. This line suggests that all creatures benefit from the blessings of Indra, particularly in terms of sustenance and prosperity. In a modern context, this can be seen in how communities rely on natural resources and favorable weather for agriculture and survival.</li>        <li><strong>vasūni jāte janamāna</strong>: This means "the wealth is born for the people." It emphasizes the idea that prosperity and abundance are meant for everyone. In today's world, this can be reflected in the concept of shared resources and the importance of equitable distribution of wealth, ensuring that all members of society have access to basic needs and opportunities.</li>        <li><strong>ojasā prati bhāgaṁ na dīdhima</strong>: This translates to "may we not be deprived of our share of energy." Here, 'ojasā' refers to vitality or energy, and 'bhāgaṁ' means share or portion. This line highlights the importance of maintaining one's strength and energy to fulfill one's duties and responsibilities. In real life, this can be related to the need for a balanced lifestyle, including proper nutrition, exercise, and mental well-being, to ensure that individuals can contribute effectively to their families and communities.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra emphasizes the interconnectedness of life, the importance of divine blessings, and the need for shared prosperity. It serves as a reminder that just as the sun nourishes all living beings, we too must ensure that resources and opportunities are available to everyone. In a practical sense, this mantra can inspire individuals and communities to work towards sustainability, equity, and collective well-being, fostering a sense of responsibility towards each other and the environment.</p>
