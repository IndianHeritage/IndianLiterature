        <ul>    <li><strong>tigmam āyudham marutām anīkaṁ</strong>: This phrase refers to the sharp weapons of the Maruts, the storm deities. The word "tigmam" means sharp or fierce, while "āyudham" means weapon. The Maruts are often associated with strength and power, representing the forces of nature.</li>        <li><strong>kas ta indra prati vajraṁ dadharṣa</strong>: Here, "kas" means who, "ta" is a particle for emphasis, "indra" refers to the king of gods, and "vajraṁ" means thunderbolt or weapon. This line questions who can withstand Indra's thunderbolt, emphasizing the invincibility of divine power.</li>        <li><strong>anāyudhāso asurā adevāś</strong>: "Anāyudhāso" means those without weapons, "asurā" refers to the demons or adversaries, and "adevāś" means non-divine beings. This line highlights the contrast between the divine and the non-divine, suggesting that those without divine support are powerless.</li>        <li><strong>cakreṇa tām̐ apa vapa ṛjīṣin</strong>: "Cakreṇa" refers to the wheel or cycle, "tām̐" means that, "apa" means away, and "vapa ṛjīṣin" can be interpreted as the act of driving away or dispelling. This line suggests the cyclical nature of conflict and resolution, where divine intervention can dispel negativity.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This mantra encapsulates the themes of divine power, the struggle between good and evil, and the importance of seeking divine support in overcoming challenges. It serves as a reminder of the strength that comes from the divine and the futility of opposing such power without it.</li>        <li><strong>Real-life Application:</strong> In everyday life, this mantra can be applied in situations where individuals face overwhelming challenges or adversities. For instance, in a competitive work environment, one might feel like they are up against insurmountable odds. By invoking the spirit of this mantra, one can seek inner strength and resilience, much like the Maruts, to overcome obstacles.</li>        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of divine support and the strength that comes from unity with higher powers.
