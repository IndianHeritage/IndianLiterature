        <ul>    <li><strong>vadhīṁ vṛtram</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "to overcome the demon Vritra." In the context of the Rigveda, Vritra represents obstacles or challenges that hinder progress and prosperity. In real life, this can be likened to personal struggles, societal issues, or any form of adversity that one must confront.</li>        <li><strong>maruta indriyeṇa</strong>: "With the strength of the Maruts." The Maruts are storm deities associated with power and energy. This suggests that one should harness their inner strength and the support of external forces to face challenges. For example, in a team setting, the collective strength of a group can help overcome significant hurdles.</li>        <li><strong>svena bhāmena</strong>: "With one's own brilliance." This emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and personal capability.

This indicates the transformation that occurs when one confronts and overcomes challenges. For instance, a student who struggles with a subject but eventually masters it through hard work becomes more confident and capable.</li>        <li><strong>aham etā manave</strong>: "I am the one who has achieved this." This reflects a sense of ownership and pride in one's accomplishments. In real life, this can be seen in individuals who take responsibility for their successes and failures, learning from each experience.</li>        <li><strong>viśvaścandrāḥ</strong>: "All the celestial bodies." This phrase symbolizes the interconnectedness of all things in the universe. It suggests that one's actions have broader implications, much like how the phases of the moon affect tides and natural cycles.</li>        <li><strong>sugā apaś</strong>: "The one who has attained happiness." This highlights the ultimate goal of overcoming challenges: achieving peace and contentment. In real life, this can be related to the pursuit of happiness through personal growth, relationships, and fulfilling work.</li>        <li><strong>cakara vajrabāhuḥ</strong>: "The one with the strong arms who acts." This signifies the importance of taking action with strength and determination. In practical terms, this can be seen in activists who fight for social justice, using their strength to bring about change.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra encapsulates the journey of overcoming obstacles through personal strength, collective support, and decisive action.
