        <ul>    <li><strong>ud īrayathā marutaḥ</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "O Maruts, let your power rise." The Maruts are storm deities in Vedic literature, often associated with wind and storms. This invocation suggests a call for the Maruts to manifest their strength and energy.</li>        <li><strong>samudrato yūyaṁ vṛṣṭiṁ varṣayathā purīṣiṇaḥ</strong>: This part means "from the ocean, may you bring forth rain." Here, the ocean symbolizes abundance and the source of life-giving water. The term "purīṣiṇaḥ" refers to the inhabitants or protectors of the city, indicating a plea for the Maruts to bless the community with rain, which is essential for agriculture and sustenance.</li>        <li><strong>na vo dasrā upa dasyanti</strong>: This translates to "may no obstacles come to you." It expresses a desire for the Maruts to be unhindered in their actions, ensuring that their blessings reach the people without any barriers.</li>        <li><strong>dhenavaḥ śubhaṁ yātām anu rathā avṛtsata</strong>: This can be interpreted as "may the cows (dhenavaḥ) bring forth good fortune, and may the chariots (rathā) not be deprived of rain." Cows are a symbol of wealth and prosperity in Vedic culture, and the mention of chariots signifies the importance of mobility and progress. This line emphasizes the connection between nature's bounty and the prosperity of the community.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This mantra highlights the interdependence between nature and human life. It reflects the ancient Vedic understanding of the environment's role in sustaining life and the importance of invoking divine forces for blessings.</li>        <li><strong>Real-life Application:</strong> In contemporary society, this mantra can be seen as a reminder of the need for environmental stewardship. Just as the Maruts are called upon to bring rain, modern communities must recognize the importance of sustainable practices to ensure water availability and agricultural productivity. For instance, farmers today often rely on weather patterns and climate conditions, paralleling the ancient reliance on divine forces for rain.</li>        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra serves as a timeless reminder of the relationship between humanity and nature. It encourages respect for natural resources and the acknowledgment of the divine forces that govern the environment. By understanding and applying these principles, individuals and communities can work towards a harmonious existence with nature, ensuring prosperity and sustainability for future generations.</li></ul>
