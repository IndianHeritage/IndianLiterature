        <ul>    <li><strong>na mā garan nadyo mātṛtamā dāsā yad īṁ susamubdham avādhuḥ</strong></li>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "Do not let the rivers, which are like mothers, be obstructed; may they flow freely and abundantly." </li>    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This line emphasizes the importance of rivers as life-giving entities, akin to mothers. In many cultures, rivers are revered for their nurturing qualities, providing water for drinking, agriculture, and sustaining ecosystems. For example, the Ganges River in India is considered sacred and is essential for millions of people who depend on it for their daily needs.</li>        <li><strong>śiro yad asya traitano vitakṣat svayaṁ dāsa uro aṁsāv api gdha</strong></li>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "The head that is aware of the divine knowledge is not a servant; even if it is a part of the body, it is not a slave." </li>    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This line suggests that true knowledge and awareness elevate an individual beyond servitude. It implies that understanding one's purpose and connection to the divine grants freedom and dignity. For instance, individuals who pursue education and self-awareness often find themselves in positions of leadership and influence, rather than servitude.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra highlights the significance of respecting natural resources, particularly rivers, and the importance of knowledge and awareness in elevating human dignity. In real life, this can be applied by advocating for environmental conservation, ensuring that rivers are protected from pollution and obstruction, and promoting education and self-awareness in communities. By doing so, we honor the nurturing aspects of nature and empower individuals to rise above servitude, contributing positively to society.</li></ul>
