It signifies the act of paying homage to the divine. In a modern context, this can be reflected in various forms of worship or gratitude, such as participating in community service or expressing appreciation for nature and its resources.</li>        <li><strong>sa no viśvā</strong>: This phrase means "may all (of us) be." It conveys a sense of unity and collective well-being.

It encourages the idea of overcoming conflicts and fostering peace. In practical terms, this can be applied in conflict resolution, where individuals or groups work towards understanding and reconciliation rather than division.</li>        <li><strong>parṣan</strong>: This word can be interpreted as "the divine" or "the sacred." It highlights the importance of recognizing the divine presence in all aspects of life. In everyday scenarios, this can manifest in mindfulness practices, where individuals acknowledge the sacredness of their experiences and surroundings.</li>        <li><strong>nāveva sukratuḥ</strong>: This translates to "may we have good intentions."
