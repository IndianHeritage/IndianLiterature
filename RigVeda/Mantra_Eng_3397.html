In real-life scenarios, it can be applied in leadership contexts, where a leader must unite their team with a shared vision and strong intentions. For example, in a corporate setting, a manager who fosters collaboration and encourages innovative thinking can lead their team to success, much like Indra leading the gods. The mantra also reminds us that true enlightenment and strength come from understanding our roots and the foundational aspects of our lives, encouraging us to seek knowledge and clarity in our pursuits.</p>
