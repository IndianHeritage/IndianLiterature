        <ul>    <li><strong>upa mā śyāvāḥ svanayena dattā</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "May the dark (or black) ones, given by the sound, come to us." Here, "upa" means "come near," "mā" refers to "dark" or "black," and "svanayena" relates to "sound" or "voice." This can symbolize the call of the divine or the attraction of positive energies towards oneself.</li>        <li><strong>vadhūmanto daśa rathāso asthuḥ</strong>: This part translates to "May the ten chariots of the bride be present." "Vadhū" means "bride," "manto" refers to "with," "daśa" means "ten," and "rathāso" means "chariots." This can be interpreted as a metaphor for the various aspects of life that support and carry us forward, much like chariots that transport a bride to her new life.</li>        <li><strong>ṣaṣṭiḥ sahasram anu gavyam āgāt</strong>: This translates to "May the thousand of the sixty come to us." "Ṣaṣṭiḥ" means "sixty," "sahasram" means "thousand," and "anu gavyam" can be interpreted as "following the path of cows," which symbolizes abundance and prosperity. This suggests a desire for wealth and resources to flow into one’s life.</li>        <li><strong>sanat kakṣīvām̐ abhipitve ahnām</strong>: This can be translated as "May we be protected by the eternal one during the day." "Sanat" means "eternal," "kakṣīvām̐" refers to "protection," and "ahnām" means "of the day." This emphasizes the importance of divine protection and guidance throughout our daily lives.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This mantra encapsulates a prayer for abundance, protection, and the presence of supportive forces in life. It reflects the interconnectedness of various aspects of existence, from the spiritual to the material.</li>        <li><strong>Real-life Application:</strong> In practical terms, this mantra can be invoked during significant life events such as weddings, new ventures, or any situation where one seeks blessings for success and protection. For instance, during a wedding ceremony, the couple may recite this mantra to invite prosperity and support from their families and the universe.</li>        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra serves as a reminder of the importance of community, support, and divine guidance in our lives. By acknowledging these elements, we can cultivate a sense of gratitude and openness to the abundance that life has to offer.</li></ul>
