Here, 'kūcit' refers to purity, while 'ūrve' signifies the earth or land. This can be likened to the importance of clean water in our lives, as it is essential for health and sustenance, much like how rivers nourish the land.</li>        <li><strong>divo na vidyut stanayanty abhraiḥ</strong> - This translates to "The lightning of the sky does not strike the clouds." It suggests that divine energy or power does not manifest in chaos but rather in a controlled manner.
