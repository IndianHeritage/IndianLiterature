This suggests the importance of wisdom and understanding that encompasses all aspects of life. In practical terms, this can relate to the value of education and learning from diverse experiences, which can lead to better decision-making in personal and professional contexts.</li>        <li><strong>aprayutām evayāvo matiṁ dāḥ</strong>: "Bestow upon us unwavering intellect." This line emphasizes the desire for a stable and clear mind.

This indicates a connection to the divine and the support we receive from higher powers. In real life, this can be interpreted as the support we find in community, family, or spiritual beliefs that guide us through difficult times.</li>        <li><strong>suvitasya bhūrer</strong>: "Of the well-being of the earth."
