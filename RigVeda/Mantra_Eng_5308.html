It reflects the journey of life where one must face challenges and integrate into a larger community. In real-life scenarios, this can be applied to personal growth, professional challenges, or community involvement. For instance, when starting a new job, one may encounter unexpected challenges (the "new things") but can rely on their inner strength (the "vajra hands") to navigate through them. The mantra serves as a reminder of resilience and the importance of community support in overcoming life's adversities.</p>
