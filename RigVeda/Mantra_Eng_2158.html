        <ul>    <li><strong>avaṁśe dyām astabhāyad</strong>: This phrase can be interpreted as "the sky (dyām) is supported (astabhāyad) by the unseen (avaṁśe)." It suggests that the vastness of the sky is held up by forces that are not visible to us. In real life, this can be likened to the unseen forces of nature, such as gravity, that keep the atmosphere intact.</li>        <li><strong>bṛhantam ā rodasī apṛṇad</strong>: Here, "bṛhantam" means "the great" or "the vast," while "ā rodasī" refers to "the two realms" (heaven and earth). "Apṛṇad" means "to fill." This can be understood as the great expanse of the universe filling the two realms of existence. An example in real life could be the way ecosystems are interconnected, where the vastness of nature supports life on Earth.</li>        <li><strong>antarikṣam</strong>: This term refers to "the space" or "the atmosphere." It signifies the area between the earth and the heavens, which is crucial for life. In our daily lives, we rely on the atmosphere for air, weather patterns, and communication technologies that depend on satellites.</li>        <li><strong>sa dhārayat pṛthivīm</strong>: "Sa" means "he" or "that," "dhārayat" means "supports," and "pṛthivīm" refers to "the earth." This line emphasizes the idea that there is a force or deity that supports the earth. In a real-life context, this can be seen in the way communities come together to support and sustain their environment through conservation efforts.</li>        <li><strong>paprathac ca somasya tā mada</strong>: "Paprathe" means "to spread" or "to expand," "somasya" refers to "of the moon," and "tā mada" can be interpreted as "the intoxication" or "the joy." This suggests that the influence of the moon spreads joy and intoxication. In real life, the moon affects tides and has been a source of inspiration for art, poetry, and cultural celebrations, such as the full moon festivals.</li>        <li><strong>indraś cakāra</strong>: "Indra" is a prominent deity in Vedic literature, often associated with strength and power, while "cakāra" means "to create" or "to make." This line indicates that Indra has a role in the creation and maintenance of the universe. In modern life, we can see this as a metaphor for leadership and the role of influential figures in shaping society and culture.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This mantra from the Rigveda encapsulates the interconnectedness of the universe, the unseen forces that support life, and the divine influences that shape our existence. Its significance lies in the recognition of the balance between the physical and spiritual realms. In real life, this can be applied in various contexts, such as environmental conservation, community support, and the appreciation of natural phenomena. By understanding these connections, we can foster a deeper respect for the world around us and strive for harmony in our lives.</li></ul>
