For example, couples who openly discuss their feelings and commitments are more likely to build a strong and lasting bond.</li>    <li><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: The idea of being connected to others can be seen in community service. When individuals come together to make commitments to help others, they can create a positive impact, even if they initially do not see the full effect of their actions.</li>    <li><strong>Self-Reflection and Growth</strong>: The concept of purification can relate to personal growth. Individuals may need to reflect on their actions and commitments, recognizing areas of ignorance or misunderstanding, and work towards self-improvement.</li></ul><br><p>In conclusion, this mantra highlights the significance of communication, community, and the process of purification in our lives.
