        <ul>    <li><strong>athā</strong>: This word translates to "now" or "therefore," indicating a transition or a new understanding.</li>    <li><strong>na</strong>: This means "not," suggesting a negation or absence.</li>    <li><strong>ubhayeṣām</strong>: This term refers to "both" or "of both kinds," indicating a duality or two aspects.</li>    <li><strong>amṛta</strong>: This word means "immortal" or "eternal," often associated with the divine or the ultimate truth.</li>    <li><strong>martyānām</strong>: This translates to "mortals" or "those who are subject to death," referring to the human condition.</li>    <li><strong>mithaḥ</strong>: This means "together" or "in mutuality," suggesting a relationship or connection.</li>    <li><strong>santu</strong>: This word means "may there be" or "let there be," expressing a wish or a desire.</li>    <li><strong>praśastayaḥ</strong>: This translates to "praises" or "commendations," indicating recognition or honor.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> The mantra can be interpreted as a call for the coexistence of both the immortal and the mortal, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and recognition between these two states of existence. It suggests that while mortals are bound by the limitations of life and death, there is a divine aspect that transcends this limitation.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Real-life Example:</strong> In our daily lives, we often encounter the duality of existence—life and death, success and failure, joy and sorrow. For instance, in a community, the elderly (who may be seen as closer to the immortal wisdom) and the youth (who represent the vibrant, mortal energy) can learn from each other. The elderly can share their experiences and wisdom, while the youth can bring fresh perspectives and energy. This mutual respect and learning can lead to a harmonious society.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The significance of this mantra lies in its reminder of the interconnectedness of all beings, regardless of their mortal or immortal status. It encourages us to foster relationships based on respect and recognition, acknowledging that both aspects contribute to the richness of life. In real-life scenarios, this can be applied in various contexts, such as family dynamics, community interactions, and even in professional environments where collaboration between different generations or experiences can lead to greater understanding and progress.</li></ul>
