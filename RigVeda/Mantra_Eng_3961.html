        <ul>    <li><strong>vṛṣṇo astoṣi</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "You (Vishnu) are the one who is praised." Here, Vishnu represents the preserver and protector in the Hindu trinity. In real life, this can be seen in the way people seek protection and guidance from higher powers or principles in times of need.</li>        <li><strong>bhūmyasya garbhaṁ</strong>: This means "the womb of the Earth." It signifies the nurturing aspect of the Earth, akin to how a mother nurtures her child. In practical terms, this can relate to agriculture and the importance of soil health for sustainable farming practices.</li>        <li><strong>trito napātam apāṁ suvṛkti</strong>: This translates to "the third offspring of the waters, with good deeds." This can refer to the importance of water in sustaining life and the idea that good actions lead to fruitful outcomes. For example, in environmental conservation, protecting water bodies leads to a healthier ecosystem.</li>        <li><strong>gṛṇīte agnir etarī</strong>: This means "the fire that is praised." Fire symbolizes energy, transformation, and purification. In everyday life, this can be seen in cooking, where fire transforms raw ingredients into nourishing meals, or in the context of personal growth, where challenges (fire) lead to transformation.</li>        <li><strong>na śūṣaiḥ</strong>: This translates to "not dry." It emphasizes the importance of vitality and abundance. In a real-world context, this can relate to the need for sustainable water management to prevent droughts and ensure food security.</li>        <li><strong>śociṣkeśo ni riṇāti vanā</strong>: This means "the one who shines, does not forsake the forest." It highlights the connection between nature and divinity, suggesting that true prosperity comes from respecting and preserving the natural world. This can be seen in modern movements advocating for reforestation and biodiversity conservation.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This mantra from the Rigveda emphasizes the interconnectedness of divinity, nature, and human actions.
