        <ul>    <li><strong>uta mātā mahiṣam anv avenad amī tvā jahati putra devāḥ</strong></li>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "O Indra, the gods have sent you to slay the demon Vritra, who is like a mother to the cattle. They abandon you, O son, if you do not act." </li>    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong>         <ul>            <li><strong>Indra:</strong> In Vedic literature, Indra is the king of the gods and the god of thunder and rain. He represents strength and power.</li>            <li><strong>Mahiṣam:</strong> Refers to the demon Vritra, who is often depicted as a serpent or dragon that obstructs the waters and is a symbol of chaos and drought.</li>            <li><strong>Putra devāḥ:</strong> This phrase emphasizes the relationship between Indra and the other gods, highlighting the expectation that he must fulfill his duty to protect and provide for them.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>athābravīd vṛtram indro haniṣyan sakhe viṣṇo vitaraṁ vi kramasva</strong></li>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "Then Indra spoke, 'I will slay Vritra, O friend Vishnu, grant me strength and let me proceed.'" </li>    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong>         <ul>            <li><strong>Vritra:</strong> Represents obstacles and challenges in life, often seen as a metaphor for ignorance or negativity that needs to be overcome.</li>            <li><strong>Vishnu:</strong> Another principal deity in Hinduism, representing preservation and protection. Indra seeks assistance from Vishnu, symbolizing the importance of collaboration and support in overcoming challenges.</li>            <li><strong>Haniṣyan:</strong> Indicates the act of slaying or overcoming, which can be interpreted as the need to confront and defeat our personal demons or challenges.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul><ul>    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This mantra emphasizes the themes of duty, strength, and the importance of collaboration in overcoming obstacles. It serves as a reminder that even the most powerful beings, like Indra, require support and guidance from others, such as Vishnu, to achieve their goals.</li>    <li><strong>Real-Life Application:</strong>         <ul>            <li>In personal life, this mantra can inspire individuals to confront their fears and challenges, much like Indra confronting Vritra. It encourages seeking help from friends or mentors when facing difficulties.</li>            <li>In a professional context, it highlights the importance of teamwork and collaboration. Just as Indra relies on Vishnu, individuals in a workplace should recognize the value of working together to achieve common goals.</li>            <li>In a broader societal context, it can be seen as a call to action for communities to unite against common challenges, such as environmental issues or social injustices, emphasizing collective strength.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
