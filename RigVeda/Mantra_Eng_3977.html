        <ul>    <li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "marutvato apratītasya jiṣṇor ajūryataḥ pra bravāmā kṛtāni | na te pūrve maghavan nāparāso na vīryaṁ nūtanaḥ kaś canāpa ||"</li>    <li><strong>Word-by-Word Meaning:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>Marutvato:</strong> Pertaining to the Maruts, the storm deities.</li>            <li><strong>Apratītasya:</strong> Of the one who is not easily perceived or understood.</li>            <li><strong>Jiṣṇor:</strong> Of the victorious or the one who conquers.</li>            <li><strong>Ajūryataḥ:</strong> From the one who is not diminished or weakened.</li>            <li><strong>Pra bravāmā:</strong> We proclaim or declare.</li>            <li><strong>Kṛtāni:</strong> The deeds or actions.</li>            <li><strong>Na te:</strong> Not yours.</li>            <li><strong>Pūrve:</strong> The former or previous ones.</li>            <li><strong>Maghavan:</strong> The one who is rich or bountiful.</li>            <li><strong>Nāparāso:</strong> Not the latter or the subsequent ones.</li>            <li><strong>Na vīryaṁ:</strong> Not the strength or valor.</li>            <li><strong>Nūtanaḥ:</strong> The new or the fresh.</li>            <li><strong>Kaś canāpa:</strong> Anyone at all.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra speaks of the Maruts, who are often associated with storms and winds, symbolizing power and energy.</li>            <li>The phrase "apratītasya jiṣṇor" suggests a connection to the idea of victory that is not easily grasped, indicating that true strength may not always be visible.</li>            <li>When we say "na te pūrve maghavan," it implies that the previous forms of abundance or strength are not the same as what is being proclaimed now, suggesting a new understanding or realization of power.</li>            <li>The mantra emphasizes the importance of recognizing new strengths and actions that may not be immediately apparent, akin to how a storm can bring both destruction and renewal.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>In personal development, individuals often face challenges that may not seem surmountable at first. However, through perseverance and the realization of inner strength, they can achieve victory over their circumstances.</li>            <li>In a business context, companies may face competition that seems overwhelming. By innovating and adapting, they can find new ways to succeed that were not previously considered.</li>            <li>In nature, storms can devastate landscapes, but they also bring necessary rain that fosters new growth, illustrating the duality of destruction and renewal.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra serves as a reminder that true strength and victory often come from within and may not always be visible at first glance.</li>            <li>It encourages individuals to look beyond the surface and recognize the potential for new beginnings and strengths in their lives.</li>            <li>In a broader sense, it highlights the cyclical nature of life, where challenges can lead to growth and transformation, making it applicable in various real-life scenarios.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
