        <ul>    <li><strong>adhāyi dhītir asasṛgram</strong>: This phrase can be interpreted as "the intellect that is grounded and stable." Here, "adhāyi" refers to something that is firmly established, while "dhītir" signifies intellect or understanding. In real life, this can be related to the importance of having a stable and clear mind when making decisions, akin to a student preparing for exams by creating a conducive study environment.</li>        <li><strong>aṁśās tīrthe na dasmam upa yanty ūmāḥ</strong>: This part translates to "the parts that do not reach the tenth shore." The "tenth shore" can symbolize a state of ultimate knowledge or enlightenment. In practical terms, this can be likened to individuals who strive for higher knowledge but may not fully grasp it due to distractions or lack of focus, similar to a person who starts a journey but gets sidetracked along the way.</li>        <li><strong>abhy ānaśma suvitasya</strong>: This phrase means "towards the well-being of the prosperous." "Suvitasya" refers to prosperity or well-being. This can be seen in real life through community initiatives aimed at improving the quality of life, such as local health programs or educational workshops that promote prosperity among community members.</li>        <li><strong>śūṣaṁ navedaso amṛtānām abhūma</strong>: This translates to "the essence of the immortal beings." Here, "amṛtānām" refers to immortality or eternal beings. This can be related to the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom that transcends time, much like the teachings of great philosophers or spiritual leaders whose ideas continue to influence generations.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra emphasizes the importance of a stable intellect, the pursuit of higher knowledge, and the well-being of the community. It serves as a reminder that while striving for enlightenment and prosperity, one must remain grounded and focused. In real life, this can be applied in various scenarios such as education, personal development, and community service, where individuals are encouraged to seek knowledge while contributing positively to society.</li></ul>
