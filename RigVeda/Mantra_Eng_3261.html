In a real-life context, this can refer to the Earth or nature, which nurtures and sustains all life forms. Just as a mother provides for her children, the Earth provides resources such as food, water, and shelter.</li>        <li><strong>anv acaṣṭa</strong>: This means "she has been revealed" or "she has been made known." This can be interpreted as the understanding or realization of the importance of nature and the environment in our lives.

It emphasizes the importance of caring for our environment and not taking it for granted.

In practical terms, this can relate to how we view our homes and communities as part of a larger ecosystem that requires harmony and balance.</li>        <li><strong>apibat somam</strong>: This translates to "Indra drank the soma." Soma is often associated with immortality and divine inspiration.
