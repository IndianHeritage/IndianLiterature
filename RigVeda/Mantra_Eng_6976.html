It suggests that true influence comes from the ability to inspire and command respect.</li>            <li>In personal development, it encourages individuals to cultivate their own strength and confidence, as these qualities attract others and create opportunities for collaboration and support.</li>            <li>In a broader context, it can be applied to societal structures where strong, ethical leadership is essential for progress and unity.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
