This can be related to the importance of family and community in nurturing future generations, highlighting the role of parents and educators in shaping society.</li>        <li><strong>tryanīkaḥ</strong>: This term means "the one who is threefold" or "having three aspects." This can be applied to various philosophies that emphasize balance, such as the balance of mind, body, and spirit in holistic health practices.</li>        <li><strong>patyate</strong>: This translates to "is worshipped" or "is revered."
