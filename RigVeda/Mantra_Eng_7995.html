        <ul>    <li><strong>sa pavasva</strong>: This phrase can be interpreted as "may you (the wind) blow." In a real-life context, this can symbolize the importance of movement and change in our lives. Just as the wind brings freshness and new beginnings, we too must embrace change to grow.</li>        <li><strong>vicarṣaṇa</strong>: This term refers to "the one who moves or travels." It signifies the journey of life, where each individual is on a path of discovery. For example, consider a student who travels to a new city for education; this journey is not just physical but also a journey of personal growth and learning.</li>        <li><strong>ā mahī rodasī</strong>: This translates to "the great earth and the sky." It emphasizes the connection between the earth and the cosmos. In our daily lives, this can be seen in our relationship with nature.
