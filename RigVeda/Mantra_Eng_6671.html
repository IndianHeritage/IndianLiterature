        <ul>    <li><strong>Word-by-Word Meaning:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>yo:</strong> who</li>            <li><strong>yajāti:</strong> sacrifices or offers</li>            <li><strong>yajāta:</strong> is sacrificed or offered</li>            <li><strong>it:</strong> thus</li>            <li><strong>sunavac:</strong> with good words or praises</li>            <li><strong>ca:</strong> and</li>            <li><strong>pacāti:</strong> cooks or prepares</li>            <li><strong>brahmed:</strong> for the Brahman or the ultimate reality</li>            <li><strong>indrasya:</strong> of Indra (the king of gods)</li>            <li><strong>cākanat:</strong> is to be known or understood</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra speaks about the act of sacrifice and offerings, emphasizing the importance of intention and the words used during such acts.</li>            <li>The phrase "yo yajāti" indicates the one who performs the sacrifice, while "yajāta" refers to what is being sacrificed. This highlights the duality of the act—both the giver and the offering are significant.</li>            <li>"Sunavac" suggests that the manner in which the offering is made, particularly the words and intentions behind it, plays a crucial role in the efficacy of the sacrifice.</li>            <li>The mention of "brahmed" and "indrasya" connects the act of sacrifice to the divine, indicating that such offerings are not merely ritualistic but are meant to connect with the higher powers and the ultimate reality.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>In modern life, this mantra can be related to the concept of intention in actions. For instance, when someone donates to charity, the intention behind the donation and the words of encouragement or support can significantly impact the outcome and the feelings of those involved.</li>            <li>In a corporate setting, when a leader acknowledges the hard work of their team (akin to "sunavac"), it not only boosts morale but also fosters a culture of appreciation and respect, which can lead to greater productivity and harmony.</li>            <li>In personal relationships, the way we communicate our feelings and intentions can either strengthen or weaken our bonds with others. Just as the mantra emphasizes the importance of words in offerings, our words in daily interactions hold power.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra from the Rigveda underscores the significance of intention and communication in our actions, particularly in acts of giving and sacrifice.</li>            <li>Its relevance extends beyond ritualistic practices to everyday life, reminding us that our intentions and the words we choose can profoundly affect our relationships and interactions.</li>            <li>By understanding and applying the principles encapsulated in this mantra, individuals can cultivate a more meaningful and connected existence, fostering a sense of community and purpose in their actions.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
