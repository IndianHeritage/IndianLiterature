        <ul>    <li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "trayaḥ kośāsaḥ ścotanti tisraś camva1ḥ supūrṇāḥ | samāne adhi bhārman ||"</li>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "Three sheaths are shining; the three are full; they rest upon the same support."</li>    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>Trayaḥ kośāsaḥ:</strong> The term "trayaḥ" means "three," and "kośāsaḥ" refers to "sheaths" or "layers." In the context of human existence, this can be interpreted as the three aspects of the self: the physical body, the mind, and the spirit.</li>            <li><strong>Ścotanti:</strong> This word means "shining" or "illuminating." It suggests that these three layers are not just present but are also vibrant and active in our lives.</li>            <li><strong>Tisraś camva1ḥ:</strong> "Tisraś" means "three," and "camva1ḥ" can be interpreted as "full" or "complete." This indicates that each of these layers is whole and contributes to the overall being.</li>            <li><strong>Supūrṇāḥ:</strong> This term reinforces the idea of fullness, suggesting that each sheath is not lacking in any way.</li>            <li><strong>Samāne adhi bhārman:</strong> "Samāne" means "the same," "adhi" means "upon," and "bhārman" refers to "support" or "foundation." This implies that all three sheaths rest upon a common foundation, which can be understood as consciousness or the universal spirit that connects all beings.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>In modern psychology, the concept of the mind-body connection reflects the idea of these three sheaths. For instance, stress (mental) can manifest as physical symptoms, illustrating the interconnectedness of the physical and mental layers.</li>            <li>In holistic health practices, such as yoga and meditation, practitioners often focus on balancing the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of their being, aligning with the idea of the three sheaths being full and vibrant.</li>            <li>In personal development, understanding that we are more than just our physical bodies can lead to a more fulfilling life. For example, engaging in activities that nourish the spirit, such as volunteering or creative expression, can enhance overall well-being.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>         The mantra emphasizes the importance of recognizing and nurturing the three aspects of our existence: the physical, mental, and spiritual. By understanding that these layers are interconnected and supported by a common foundation, we can strive for balance and harmony in our lives. This understanding is applicable in various real-life scenarios, from personal health and wellness to spiritual growth and interpersonal relationships. Embracing this holistic view can lead to a more enriched and meaningful life experience.    </li></ul>
