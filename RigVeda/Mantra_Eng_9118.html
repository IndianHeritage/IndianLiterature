        <ul>    <li><strong>uta kaṇvaṁ nṛṣadaḥ putram āhur</strong>: This phrase can be translated to "the Kaṇva sages have called forth the son of Nṛṣada." Here, "Kaṇva" refers to a lineage of sages known for their wisdom, while "Nṛṣada" signifies a person or a group associated with strength and valor. This highlights the importance of lineage and the passing of knowledge through generations.</li>        <li><strong>uta śyāvo dhanam ādatta vājī</strong>: This translates to "the dark one (or the one with dark features) has obtained wealth, like a horse." The term "śyāva" can refer to someone who is dark in complexion, and "vājī" relates to horses, which are often symbols of power and wealth in ancient texts. This suggests that wealth can come to those who are strong and capable, much like a horse that is vital for transportation and status.</li>        <li><strong>pra kṛṣṇāya ruśad apinvatodhar</strong>: This means "to the one who is black (or dark), may we be uplifted." The term "kṛṣṇa" often symbolizes the divine or the ultimate reality in Hindu philosophy. This line emphasizes the aspiration for elevation and enlightenment through devotion to a higher power.</li>        <li><strong>ṛtam atra nakir asmā apīpet</strong>: This translates to "truth is here; may we not be deprived of it." "Ritam" refers to cosmic order or truth, and this line expresses a desire to remain connected to this truth, suggesting that it is essential for a fulfilling life.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This mantra encapsulates themes of lineage, strength, wealth, devotion, and the pursuit of truth.
