Here, "uccā" means high or elevated, "te" means your, "jātam" means born, and "andhaso" refers to the blind or those who lack vision. This can symbolize the idea that even those who may seem to lack insight or understanding can have a significant and elevated purpose in life.</li>        <li><strong>Divi ṣad bhūmy ā dade:</strong> This translates to "In the heavens, you give six realms."

"Ugraṁ" means fierce or powerful, "śarma" refers to protection or shelter, "mahi" means great, and "śravaḥ" means fame or renown. This indicates that true protection comes from a powerful source, and that greatness is often accompanied by recognition and respect.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> Consider a person who has faced significant challenges in life, perhaps someone who has overcome adversity such as a disability or a difficult upbringing.
