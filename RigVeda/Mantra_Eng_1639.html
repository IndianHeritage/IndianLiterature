        <ul>    <li><strong>caturbhiḥ sākaṁ navatiṁ ca nāmabhiś</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "together with the four (directions) and the ninety names." Here, the number four often symbolizes completeness or wholeness, as it represents the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West). The number ninety can signify a multitude or a vast array of identities or aspects.</li>        <li><strong>cakraṁ na vṛttaṁ vyatīm̐r avīvipat</strong>: This translates to "the wheel does not turn, it does not deviate." The 'cakra' or wheel is a common symbol in many cultures, representing cycles, movement, and the interconnectedness of life. The phrase suggests stability and the idea that despite the multitude of names and identities, there is a core essence that remains unchanged.</li>        <li><strong>bṛhaccharīro vimimāna</strong>: This means "the great body (or form) has manifested." This can be interpreted as the emergence of a greater reality or consciousness that encompasses all beings and phenomena. It signifies the idea of unity in diversity, where all forms are manifestations of a singular essence.</li>        <li><strong>ṛkvabhir yuvākumāraḥ praty ety āhavam</strong>: This translates to "the youthful one returns to the call of the Riks." The term 'yuvākumāra' refers to a youthful figure, often symbolizing potential, energy, and new beginnings. The 'Riks' are the hymns or verses of the Rigveda, representing wisdom and knowledge. This line suggests that the youthful energy is drawn back to the source of wisdom, indicating a cycle of learning and growth.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This mantra encapsulates the essence of unity amidst diversity, the importance of wisdom, and the cyclical nature of existence. It emphasizes that while there are many identities and forms, there is an underlying truth that remains constant.</li>        <li><strong>Real-life Application:</strong> In our daily lives, this mantra can remind us to seek unity in diversity. For instance, in a multicultural society, recognizing that despite different backgrounds, we share a common humanity can foster harmony. In personal growth, it encourages us to return to our core values and wisdom as we navigate life's challenges.</li>        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra serves as a profound reminder of the interconnectedness of all beings and the importance of wisdom in guiding our actions. It encourages us to embrace our diverse identities while remaining anchored in a shared essence, ultimately leading to a more harmonious existence.</li></ul>
