        <ul>    <li><strong>na yo varāya marutām iva svanaḥ</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "He who is not to be feared, like the sound of the Maruts (storm deities)." The Maruts are often associated with storms and winds, representing power and might. In real life, this can be likened to a person who possesses great strength or authority but is not intimidating or threatening to others.</li>        <li><strong>seneva sṛṣṭā divyā yathāśaniḥ</strong>: This translates to "Like a divine creation, as if born from the thunder." Here, the imagery of thunder signifies a powerful and awe-inspiring force. In everyday life, this can be compared to someone who inspires respect and admiration through their actions and character, much like a leader who commands attention without demanding it.</li>        <li><strong>agnir jambhais tigitair atti bharvati</strong>: This means "The fire (Agni) consumes with its flames, as it rises." Agni, the fire god, symbolizes transformation and purification. In practical terms, this can be seen in how challenges in life can lead to personal growth and development, much like how fire transforms raw materials into something valuable.</li>        <li><strong>yodho na śatrūn sa vanā ny ṛñjate</strong>: This translates to "The warrior does not fear his enemies; he does not retreat." This line emphasizes courage and resilience in the face of adversity. In real life, this can be exemplified by individuals who stand firm in their beliefs and values, even when faced with opposition or challenges.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra encapsulates themes of strength, courage, and transformation. It teaches us that true power lies not in instilling fear but in inspiring respect and admiration. In our daily lives, we can apply these principles by striving to be leaders who uplift others, embracing challenges as opportunities for growth, and standing firm in our convictions. This mantra serves as a reminder that resilience and integrity are key to overcoming obstacles and achieving greatness.</li></ul>
