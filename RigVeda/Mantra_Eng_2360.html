The word "śukrebhiḥ" refers to purity and brightness, while "ghṛtanirṇig" relates to ghee, a symbol of nourishment and prosperity. "Apsu" refers to waters, indicating a connection to abundance and sustenance.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> The imagery of youth stirring the waters can be likened to the energy and creativity of young people in society.
