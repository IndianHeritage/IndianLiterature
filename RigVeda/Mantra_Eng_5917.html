It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the duality of existence—both the spiritual and the material. In real life, this can be applied in various ways, such as in personal growth, where one seeks to expand their understanding and consciousness while remaining grounded in reality. It also serves as a reminder of the limitations of human understanding in grasping the full magnitude of the divine. This mantra encourages individuals to seek a balance between their spiritual aspirations and their earthly responsibilities, fostering a holistic approach to life.</p>
