        <ul>    <li><strong>mo ṣu devā adaḥ sva1r ava pādi divas pari</strong>: This line can be interpreted as a call to the divine beings (devas) to grant blessings and prosperity. The phrase "mo ṣu" suggests a plea or invocation, while "devā" refers to the gods. "sva1r" indicates the heavenly realm, and "ava pādi" can be understood as a request for guidance or support in our earthly journey.</li>        <li><strong>mā somyasya śambhuvaḥ</strong>: Here, "mā" means "not" or "do not," and "somyasya" refers to the moon or a gentle, soothing aspect. "śambhuvaḥ" can be interpreted as a reference to auspiciousness or well-being. This line emphasizes the importance of maintaining a peaceful and harmonious state, avoiding negativity or conflict.</li>        <li><strong>śūne bhūma kadā cana</strong>: "śūne" means "empty" or "void," while "bhūma" refers to the earth or the material world. "kadā cana" translates to "at any time" or "ever." This line reflects on the transient nature of material possessions and the emptiness that can accompany a life focused solely on material gain.</li>        <li><strong>vittam me asya rodasī</strong>: "vittam" means "wealth" or "prosperity," while "me" indicates possession ("my"). "asya rodasī" refers to the celestial or cosmic realm. This line expresses a desire for wealth that is not just material but also spiritual, suggesting that true prosperity encompasses both physical and spiritual well-being.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Significance and Real-Life Application:</strong> This mantra encapsulates a holistic approach to life, emphasizing the balance between material and spiritual wealth. In today's fast-paced world, where materialism often overshadows spiritual growth, this mantra serves as a reminder to seek harmony and fulfillment beyond mere possessions.</li>        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The RigVeda mantra encourages individuals to invoke divine blessings for a prosperous life while maintaining a peaceful and harmonious existence. It highlights the importance of recognizing the emptiness that can accompany a solely materialistic approach and advocates for a balanced pursuit of both material and spiritual wealth. In real life, this can be applied by engaging in practices such as meditation, community service, and mindful consumption, fostering a sense of gratitude and connection to the divine.</li></ul>
