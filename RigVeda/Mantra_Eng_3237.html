        <ul>    <li><strong>nū ṣṭuta indra</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "O Indra, who is praised." Indra is the king of the gods in Vedic literature, often associated with rain, thunder, and war. In real life, this can be likened to seeking the blessings of a higher power or authority in times of need.</li>        <li><strong>nū gṛṇāna iṣaṁ</strong>: This means "we sing your praises." It emphasizes the importance of gratitude and recognition of the divine or the forces that govern our lives. For example, in many cultures, people express gratitude through prayers or rituals, acknowledging the support they receive from the universe.</li>        <li><strong>jaritre nadyo3 na pīpeḥ</strong>: This translates to "the rivers that flow, do not cease." Rivers are often symbolic of life, continuity, and sustenance. In a real-life context, this can represent the ongoing flow of resources and opportunities in our lives, reminding us to remain open to the abundance around us.</li>        <li><strong>akāri te harivo</strong>: This means "I have made for you, O Hariva." Hariva can be interpreted as a reference to the divine or a higher consciousness. This line suggests the act of creation or offering, which can be related to how individuals contribute to their communities or the world through their actions and intentions.</li>        <li><strong>brahma navyaṁ</strong>: This translates to "new Brahman." Brahman in Vedic philosophy represents the ultimate reality or cosmic spirit. The idea of "new" suggests innovation and the continuous evolution of understanding and spirituality. In real life, this can be seen in how individuals seek new knowledge and experiences to grow spiritually and intellectually.</li>        <li><strong>dhiyā syāma rathyaḥ sadāsāḥ</strong>: This means "may we always be endowed with wisdom." Wisdom is a crucial aspect of human life, guiding decisions and actions. In practical terms, this can relate to the importance of education, mentorship, and lifelong learning in achieving personal and professional success.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra emphasizes the significance of recognizing and praising the divine forces in our lives, the continuity of resources, the act of creation, and the pursuit of wisdom.
