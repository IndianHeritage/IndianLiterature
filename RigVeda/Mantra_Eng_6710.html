        <ul>    <li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "ihi tisraḥ parāvata ihi pañca janām̐ ati | dhenā indrāvacākaśat ||"</li>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "Come here, O threefold (or three), come here, O five beings; with the hundredfold (or abundant) wealth of Indra."</li>        <li><strong>Word Breakdown:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>ihi:</strong> Here, indicating a call or invitation.</li>            <li><strong>tisraḥ:</strong> Referring to three, which can symbolize various triads in life, such as mind, body, and spirit.</li>            <li><strong>parāvata:</strong> Often interpreted as 'the highest' or 'the supreme', suggesting a call to higher consciousness or awareness.</li>            <li><strong>pañca:</strong> Referring to five, which can represent the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and space) that constitute the universe.</li>            <li><strong>janām̐:</strong> Beings or people, indicating a collective or community.</li>            <li><strong>ati:</strong> Beyond or transcending, suggesting a movement towards something greater.</li>            <li><strong>dhenā:</strong> Wealth or abundance, often associated with nourishment and prosperity.</li>            <li><strong>indrāvacākaśat:</strong> The hundredfold wealth of Indra, symbolizing divine abundance and blessings.</li>        </ul>    </li><br>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra can be seen as a call to gather resources and support from both the physical and spiritual realms. For instance, in a community project, individuals may come together (the three and five) to create something greater than themselves, pooling their talents and resources.</li>            <li>The concept of 'three' and 'five' can also be reflected in teamwork dynamics, where diverse skills (like the five elements) contribute to a successful outcome, much like how different departments in a company work together to achieve a common goal.</li>            <li>The invocation of Indra's wealth can be likened to seeking divine guidance or inspiration in times of need, such as during a challenging business venture or personal crisis, where one looks for abundance in creativity and solutions.</li>        </ul>    </li><br>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra emphasizes the importance of community, collaboration, and the pursuit of higher consciousness. It serves as a reminder that by coming together and transcending individual limitations, we can access greater abundance and prosperity.</li>            <li>In real life, this can be applied in various scenarios, such as community service, teamwork in professional settings, or personal growth endeavors, where collective effort leads to shared success and fulfillment.</li>            <li>Ultimately, the mantra encourages us to recognize the interconnectedness of all beings and the potential for collective abundance when we unite our strengths and aspirations.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
