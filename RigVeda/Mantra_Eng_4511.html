        <ul>    <li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "nahi te pūrtam akṣipad bhuvan nemānāṁ vaso | athā duvo vanavase ||"</li>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "Indeed, you do not possess the fullness of the world; therefore, you are not the master of the two realms."</li>    <li><strong>Word Breakdown:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>nahi:</strong> indeed, not</li>            <li><strong>te:</strong> you</li>            <li><strong>pūrtam:</strong> fullness, completeness</li>            <li><strong>akṣipad:</strong> to possess, to hold</li>            <li><strong>bhuvan:</strong> world, realm</li>            <li><strong>nemānāṁ:</strong> master, ruler</li>            <li><strong>vaso:</strong> of the two</li>            <li><strong>athā:</strong> therefore</li>            <li><strong>duvo:</strong> two</li>            <li><strong>vanavase:</strong> realms, domains</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra reflects on the limitations of human existence and the understanding that no individual can claim complete ownership or mastery over the entirety of the world.</li>            <li>It emphasizes humility and the recognition that our control is limited to certain aspects of life, and we must acknowledge the vastness of the universe beyond our grasp.</li>            <li>For example, in a corporate setting, a CEO may lead a company, but they cannot control market forces, economic downturns, or global events that impact their business. This illustrates the idea that despite one's position, there are larger forces at play.</li>            <li>In personal life, an individual may strive for success and happiness, yet they cannot control every outcome or circumstance, such as health issues or unexpected life changes. This teaches acceptance and adaptability.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>        <ul>            <li>The significance of this mantra lies in its call for humility and awareness of our limitations. It encourages individuals to recognize that while we can strive for success and mastery in our lives, we must also accept that we are part of a larger system.</li>            <li>This understanding can lead to a more balanced approach to life, where one seeks to do their best while remaining open to the unpredictability of existence.</li>            <li>In real-life scenarios, this mantra can be applied in various contexts, such as leadership, personal relationships, and self-development, reminding us to remain grounded and respectful of the forces beyond our control.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
