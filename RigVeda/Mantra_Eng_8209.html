In real life, this can be seen in leaders or mentors who provide wisdom and direction, much like how the moon guides travelers at night.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This mantra emphasizes the importance of courage, leadership, and guidance in both personal and communal contexts.
