        <ul>    <li><strong>na yasya sātur janitor avāri</strong>: This phrase can be translated to "He who has no protector or guardian." It emphasizes the importance of having support and guidance in life. In real life, this can be seen in the context of individuals who may feel lost or unsupported, such as children in foster care or those facing personal crises.</li>        <li><strong>na mātarāpitarā nū cid iṣṭau</strong>: This translates to "Neither mother nor father can provide help." This line highlights the idea that sometimes, even our closest family members may not be able to assist us in times of need. For example, a person may face challenges that their parents cannot understand or help with, such as mental health issues or career choices.</li>        <li><strong>adhā mitro na sudhitaḥ</strong>: This means "Even friends may not be wise." It suggests that not all friendships are beneficial or supportive. In real life, this can be illustrated by friendships that may lead to negative influences, such as peer pressure among teenagers or toxic relationships in adulthood.</li>        <li><strong>pāvako3 'gnir dīdāya mānuṣīṣu vikṣu</strong>: This translates to "The fire that illuminates among humans." Fire symbolizes knowledge, enlightenment, and transformation. In a practical sense, this can refer to education and the pursuit of knowledge that helps individuals navigate their lives. For instance, a person who seeks higher education or vocational training can be seen as harnessing this 'fire' to improve their circumstances.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra reflects the significance of seeking guidance and support in life, acknowledging that sometimes, those we expect to help may not be able to do so. It encourages individuals to seek knowledge and enlightenment as a means of navigating challenges. In real life, this can be applicable in various scenarios, such as pursuing education, seeking mentorship, or finding community support. Ultimately, it teaches us the value of self-reliance and the importance of seeking wisdom in our journey through life.</p>
