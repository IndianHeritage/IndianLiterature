        <ul>    <li><strong>amīṣāṁ cittam pratilobhayantī</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "the mind that is attracted by desires." It refers to the human tendency to be drawn towards various desires and distractions in life. For example, in modern society, people often find themselves distracted by social media, consumerism, and the pursuit of material wealth, which can lead to a restless mind.</li>        <li><strong>gṛhāṇāṅgāny apve parehi</strong>: This part means "may you take away the attachments." It suggests a plea to let go of these desires and attachments that bind us. In real life, this can be seen in practices like minimalism, where individuals choose to declutter their lives and focus on what truly matters, such as relationships and personal growth.</li>        <li><strong>abhi prehi nir daha hṛtsu</strong>: This translates to "may you not burn in the heart." It implies a desire for emotional peace and the avoidance of suffering caused by unfulfilled desires. For instance, in the context of relationships, holding onto past grievances can lead to emotional turmoil. Letting go of such feelings can lead to a more peaceful existence.</li>        <li><strong>śokair andhenāmitrās tamasā sacantām</strong>: This phrase means "may we be free from the darkness of grief and the company of enemies." It emphasizes the importance of surrounding ourselves with positive influences and avoiding negativity. In real life, this can be applied by choosing friends and environments that uplift us rather than those that bring us down.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra serves as a profound reminder of the importance of mental clarity and emotional well-being. It encourages individuals to recognize and detach from their desires, seek peace within, and surround themselves with positivity. In today's fast-paced world, where distractions and negativity are rampant, this mantra is highly applicable.
