The sun symbolizes knowledge, enlightenment, and the source of life.</li>            <li>The "two wheels" can be interpreted as the dual nature of reality: the physical and the spiritual. Just as the sun provides light and warmth, these two aspects provide guidance and sustenance to life.</li>            <li>The "one hidden wheel" refers to the deeper, often unrecognized essence of existence. This can be likened to the subconscious mind or the deeper truths of life that are not immediately visible.</li>            <li>In real life, this can be seen in the balance between our material pursuits (the two visible wheels) and our spiritual or inner growth (the hidden wheel). For example, a person may focus on career success while neglecting their mental and emotional well-being.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>        <ul>            <li>The significance of this mantra lies in its reminder to seek balance in life. It encourages individuals to recognize both the visible and hidden aspects of their existence.</li>            <li>In practical terms, this can be applied by ensuring that while we strive for success in our careers (the two wheels), we also dedicate time to self-reflection, meditation, and understanding our inner selves (the hidden wheel).</li>            <li>Ultimately, this mantra serves as a guide for holistic living, urging us to harmonize our external achievements with our internal growth, leading to a more fulfilling and enlightened life.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
