        <ul>    <li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "somam manyate papivān yat sampiṁṣanty oṣadhim | somaṁ yam brahmāṇo vidur na tasyāśnāti kaś cana ||"</li>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "The one who drinks the soma, who is a sinner, is the one who crushes the herbs; the soma that the wise ones know, no one else can consume."</li>    <li><strong>Word-by-Word Explanation:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>Somam:</strong> Refers to the soma plant, which is considered sacred and is associated with immortality and divine consciousness.</li>            <li><strong>Manyate:</strong> Means "thinks" or "considers," indicating a mental or philosophical engagement.</li>            <li><strong>Papivān:</strong> Translates to "the sinner" or "one who has committed sins," suggesting a moral or ethical dimension.</li>            <li><strong>Yat:</strong> Means "that which," introducing a clause that describes the action or state.</li>            <li><strong>Sampiṁṣanty:</strong> Means "crushes" or "presses," referring to the act of extracting essence from herbs.</li>            <li><strong>Oṣadhim:</strong> Refers to "herbs" or "plants," which are often associated with healing and nourishment.</li>            <li><strong>Brahmāṇo:</strong> Refers to "the wise" or "the learned," indicating those who possess knowledge and understanding.</li>            <li><strong>Vidur:</strong> Means "know" or "understand," emphasizing the importance of wisdom.</li>            <li><strong>Na:</strong> Means "not," indicating negation.</li>            <li><strong>Tasyāśnāti:</strong> Means "eats" or "consumes," referring to the act of taking in or partaking.</li>            <li><strong>Kaś cana:</strong> Means "anyone" or "any person," suggesting exclusivity in the consumption of the soma.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>The soma plant can be likened to the pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment in modern life. Just as the soma is crushed to extract its essence, individuals must engage in rigorous study and self-reflection to gain wisdom.</li>            <li>The idea of a "sinner" who consumes the soma can be compared to individuals who seek shortcuts to success or enlightenment without ethical considerations. For instance, someone who engages in dishonest practices to achieve their goals may be seen as a "sinner" in this context.</li>            <li>The wise individuals (Brahmāṇo) represent mentors or teachers in our lives who guide us in our pursuit of knowledge, much like how a guru or a knowledgeable friend helps us navigate challenges.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>         The mantra emphasizes the importance of ethical conduct and the pursuit of true knowledge. It suggests that while many may seek the fruits of wisdom (soma), only those who approach it with integrity and understanding can truly partake in its benefits. In real life, this can be applied to various fields such as education, business, and personal development, where the means of achieving success should align with moral values and wisdom. The mantra serves as a reminder that true enlightenment is reserved for those who earn it through righteous actions and deep understanding.</li></ul>
