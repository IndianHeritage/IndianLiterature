For instance, herbal medicine is a practical application of this idea, where we use nature's resources for our well-being.</li>        <li><strong>bhagaḥ puraṁdhir</strong>: This translates to "may the divine wealth and prosperity." "Bhagaḥ" refers to "wealth" or "prosperity," and "puraṁdhir" signifies "the one who brings."

For example, cultivating a mindset of gratitude can attract more positivity and abundance.</li>        <li><strong>jinvatu pra rāye</strong>: This means "may it bring us prosperity." "Jinvatu" signifies "may it bring," and "pra rāye" refers to "prosperity." This is a hopeful conclusion, emphasizing the desire for a fruitful and prosperous life. In real life, this can be seen in our aspirations for success in various endeavors, whether in career, relationships, or personal growth.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra encapsulates a profound desire for enlightenment, strength, and prosperity through the divine light of knowledge and nature's resources.
