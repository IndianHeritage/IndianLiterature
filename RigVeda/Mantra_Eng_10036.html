        <ul>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "Divine abundance, the offerings to the gods, do not satisfy the greedy; however, those who are generous and dedicated in their offerings are blessed with abundance."</li>        <li><strong>Word-by-Word Meaning:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>daivī:</strong> divine</li>            <li><strong>pūrtir:</strong> abundance or fulfillment</li>            <li><strong>dakṣiṇā:</strong> offerings or donations</li>            <li><strong>devayajyā:</strong> worship or offerings to the gods</li>            <li><strong>na:</strong> not</li>            <li><strong>kavāribhyo:</strong> to the greedy or those who are selfish</li>            <li><strong>nahi:</strong> indeed or certainly</li>            <li><strong>te:</strong> they</li>            <li><strong>pṛṇanti:</strong> satisfy or fulfill</li>            <li><strong>athā:</strong> however</li>            <li><strong>naraḥ:</strong> a person or human</li>            <li><strong>prayatadakṣiṇāso:</strong> those who are generous and dedicated</li>            <li><strong>avadyabhiyā:</strong> with pure intentions</li>            <li><strong>bahavaḥ:</strong> many or numerous</li>            <li><strong>pṛṇanti:</strong> satisfy or fulfill</li>        </ul>    </li>        <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>In a community, individuals who contribute selflessly to local charities or help those in need often find that their lives are enriched in unexpected ways, such as forming strong bonds with others and receiving support in times of their own need.</li>            <li>In a workplace, employees who go above and beyond to assist their colleagues without expecting anything in return often find themselves recognized and rewarded, creating a positive work environment.</li>        </ul>    </li>        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>         The mantra emphasizes the importance of selfless giving and the idea that true abundance comes from generosity and dedication rather than from selfishness. In real life, this principle can be applied in various contexts, such as community service, workplace collaboration, and personal relationships. By embodying the spirit of giving, individuals not only contribute to the well-being of others but also cultivate a fulfilling and enriched life for themselves. This mantra serves as a reminder that the act of giving, when done with pure intentions, leads to a cycle of abundance and satisfaction for all involved.    </li></ul>
