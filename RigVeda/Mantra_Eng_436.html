It symbolizes knowledge, wisdom, and enlightenment. In practical terms, this can be associated with the pursuit of knowledge and truth in our lives, guiding us away from ignorance and towards understanding.</li>        <li><strong>yaviṣṭhya</strong>: This word can be interpreted as "the one who is to be worshipped" or "the one who is revered."
