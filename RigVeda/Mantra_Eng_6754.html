        <ul>    <li><strong>Word-by-Word Meaning:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>ya:</strong> who</li>            <li><strong>ṛjrā:</strong> straight, upright</li>            <li><strong>vātaraṁhaso:</strong> of the powerful winds</li>            <li><strong>'ruṣāso:</strong> of the angry ones</li>            <li><strong>raghuṣyadaḥ:</strong> of the swift-moving</li>            <li><strong>bhrājante:</strong> shine, radiate</li>            <li><strong>sūryā:</strong> like the sun</li>            <li><strong>iva:</strong> as</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra speaks of the powerful forces of nature, particularly the winds, which are described as both strong and capable of anger.</li>            <li>The phrase "who shine like the sun" suggests that these forces, despite their potential for destruction, also possess a radiant and life-giving quality.</li>            <li>It reflects the duality of nature, where power can be both constructive and destructive, much like the sun that provides warmth and light but can also cause drought and destruction if too intense.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>In meteorology, strong winds can lead to both beneficial rain and destructive storms. For instance, hurricanes can bring much-needed water to drought-stricken areas but can also cause devastating damage.</li>            <li>In personal life, individuals may experience anger or frustration (the 'angry winds') but can channel that energy into positive actions, much like how the sun can be both a source of life and a force of destruction.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra emphasizes the importance of recognizing the dual nature of powerful forces in our lives, whether they be natural phenomena or emotional states.</li>            <li>It teaches us to harness our inner strength and direct it positively, much like the sun that can illuminate and nurture life.</li>            <li>In real-life scenarios, understanding this duality can help individuals manage their emotions and reactions, leading to personal growth and resilience.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
