For example, in the United States, the bald eagle represents freedom and independence.</li>        <li><strong>upa yat patantaṁ</strong>: This means "approaching as it descends." It signifies the act of coming down from a higher place, which can be interpreted as gaining wisdom or insight from a higher perspective.
