        <ul>    <li><strong>te hi vasvo vasavānās</strong>: This phrase can be translated to "Indeed, you are the essence of all that is." Here, "te" refers to the divine or the higher power, while "vasvo" and "vasavānās" signify the fundamental nature of existence and abundance. In real life, this can be understood as recognizing the interconnectedness of all beings and the divine presence in everything around us.</li>        <li><strong>te apramūrā mahobhiḥ</strong>: This translates to "You are beyond measure and greatness." The term "apramūrā" indicates something that cannot be quantified or limited, while "mahobhiḥ" refers to greatness or vastness. This can be related to the concept of the universe or the divine being beyond human comprehension, much like the vastness of the cosmos that we can observe but not fully understand.</li>        <li><strong>vratā rakṣante viśvāhā</strong>: This means "The vows protect all." "Vratā" refers to vows or commitments, while "rakṣante" means to protect, and "viśvāhā" signifies all or the universe. This can be interpreted as the idea that our commitments and ethical principles serve as a protective force in our lives. For example, when individuals commit to honesty and integrity, they create a foundation of trust that safeguards their relationships and communities.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This mantra emphasizes the divine essence present in all aspects of life and the importance of recognizing this interconnectedness. It highlights the idea that the universe is vast and beyond our understanding, yet it is also governed by principles that we can adhere to for protection and guidance.</li>        <li><strong>Real-life Application:</strong> In daily life, this mantra can inspire individuals to cultivate a sense of reverence for the world around them. By acknowledging the divine in nature and in each other, people can foster compassion and empathy. Additionally, adhering to ethical principles and commitments can lead to a more harmonious and secure community.</li></ul>
