        <ul>    <li><strong>yajñasya ketuḥ</strong>: This phrase refers to the "flag" or "banner" of the sacrifice (yajña). In Vedic tradition, yajñas are rituals performed to invoke divine blessings. The "flag" symbolizes the purpose and intention behind these rituals.</li>    <li><strong>pavate svadhvaraḥ</strong>: This means "the wind blows with its own nature." Here, "pavate" signifies the wind, and "svadhvaraḥ" indicates its inherent qualities.

"Devānām" means "of the gods," and "upa yāti niṣkṛtam" suggests that it approaches the divine in a purified state.

It symbolizes abundance and the flow of resources or blessings. In real life, this can be related to the idea of having multiple avenues of support or prosperity.</li>    <li><strong>pari kośam arṣati</strong>: "Pari" means "around," and "kośam" refers to "the sheath" or "the covering." "Arṣati" indicates the act of shaking or moving. This can be interpreted as the idea that the divine presence surrounds and supports us, even when we may not be aware of it.</li>    <li><strong>vṛṣā pavitram aty eti roruvat</strong>: "Vṛṣā" refers to strength or power, "pavitram" means "pure," and "aty eti roruvat" suggests transcending or going beyond. This can be understood as the strength of purity that allows one to rise above challenges and obstacles, akin to how individuals can overcome difficulties through integrity and virtue.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>The mantra emphasizes the importance of intention, purity, and the natural flow of life.
