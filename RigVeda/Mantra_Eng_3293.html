        <ul>    <li><strong>nū ṣṭuta indra</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "O Indra, who is praised." Indra is the king of the gods in Vedic literature, often associated with rain, thunder, and war. In real life, this can be likened to seeking guidance or blessings from a higher power or authority in times of need.</li>        <li><strong>nū gṛṇāna iṣaṁ</strong>: This means "we sing your praises." It reflects the importance of gratitude and recognition of the forces that help us in our lives. For example, acknowledging the contributions of mentors or leaders in our personal or professional journeys.</li>        <li><strong>jaritre nadyo3 na pīpeḥ</strong>: This translates to "the rivers that flow, do not dry up." Rivers symbolize sustenance and life. In a real-life context, this can represent the continuous flow of resources, knowledge, or support that we rely on. Just as rivers nourish the land, so too do our relationships and communities nourish us.</li>        <li><strong>akāri te harivo</strong>: This means "I have made for you, O Hariva." Hariva can be interpreted as a reference to the divine or a higher purpose. This line emphasizes the act of creation and contribution, akin to how individuals strive to create value in their communities or workplaces.</li>        <li><strong>brahma navyaṁ</strong>: This translates to "new Brahman." Brahman represents the ultimate reality or cosmic spirit in Hindu philosophy. In practical terms, this can signify innovation and the pursuit of new ideas or spiritual growth in our lives.</li>        <li><strong>dhiyā syāma rathyaḥ sadāsāḥ</strong>: This means "may we always be endowed with wisdom." Wisdom is crucial in making informed decisions. In everyday life, this can relate to the importance of education, experience, and reflection in guiding our actions and choices.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra emphasizes the significance of praise, gratitude, sustenance, creation, innovation, and wisdom.
