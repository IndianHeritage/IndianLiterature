        <ul>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> The mantra can be translated as: "The Maruts (the storm deities) do not die, they do not get killed, they do not suffer, they do not weaken, they do not perish. No one can approach them, neither the sages nor the kings." </li>        <li><strong>Meaning of Key Terms:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>Maruts:</strong> These are the storm gods in Vedic literature, symbolizing strength, power, and the forces of nature.</li>            <li><strong>Jīyate:</strong> Means "to live" or "to exist." This indicates the eternal nature of the Maruts.</li>            <li><strong>Hanyate:</strong> Means "to be killed." This emphasizes the invincibility of the Maruts.</li>            <li><strong>Sredhati:</strong> Means "to suffer." This suggests that the Maruts are beyond pain and suffering.</li>            <li><strong>Vyathate:</strong> Means "to weaken." This indicates their unyielding strength.</li>            <li><strong>Riṣyati:</strong> Means "to perish." This reinforces the idea of their immortality.</li>            <li><strong>Rāya:</strong> Refers to wealth or prosperity, indicating that the Maruts are not influenced by material desires.</li>            <li><strong>Upa dasyanti:</strong> Means "to approach." This suggests that the Maruts are beyond the reach of ordinary beings.</li>            <li><strong>Rṣi:</strong> Refers to sages or seers, indicating that even the wisest cannot comprehend their essence.</li>            <li><strong>Rājānaṁ:</strong> Refers to kings, symbolizing power and authority, which are also unable to affect the Maruts.</li>            <li><strong>Suṣūdatha:</strong> Means "to be harmed" or "to be defeated," emphasizing their invulnerability.</li>        </ul>    </li>        <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>The Maruts can be likened to natural forces such as hurricanes or thunderstorms, which are powerful and uncontrollable. Just as these forces cannot be subdued, the mantra reflects the idea that certain aspects of nature and existence are beyond human influence.</li>            <li>In a personal context, individuals may face challenges and adversities in life. The mantra serves as a reminder that, like the Maruts, one can cultivate resilience and strength, remaining unyielding in the face of difficulties.</li>            <li>In leadership, the mantra suggests that true power lies in understanding and respecting forces beyond one's control, such as public opinion or natural events, rather than attempting to dominate them.</li>        </ul>    </li>        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>         The significance of this mantra lies in its portrayal of the eternal and invincible nature of certain forces, both in the cosmos and within ourselves. It teaches us about resilience, the importance of recognizing our limitations, and the understanding that some aspects of life are beyond our control. In real-life scenarios, this mantra can inspire individuals to cultivate inner strength, embrace challenges, and respect the powerful forces of nature and existence that shape our lives. By acknowledging the Maruts' invincibility, we can learn to navigate our own lives with courage and wisdom.</li></ul>
