        <ul>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "Kings do not attain glory through praises; they are nourished by the offerings of the people. The sacrifice is not performed by the seven creators."</li>        <li><strong>Word Breakdown:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>rājāno:</strong> Kings or rulers, representing authority and governance.</li>            <li><strong>na:</strong> Not, indicating negation.</li>            <li><strong>praśastibhiḥ:</strong> Praises or commendations, suggesting that mere words do not confer true honor.</li>            <li><strong>somāso:</strong> Nourished or sustained, implying a deeper form of sustenance.</li>            <li><strong>gobhir:</strong> By the offerings or contributions of the people, highlighting the importance of community support.</li>            <li><strong>añjate:</strong> To be nourished or sustained, indicating a reciprocal relationship.</li>            <li><strong>yajño:</strong> Sacrifice or offering, a central theme in Vedic rituals.</li>            <li><strong>na:</strong> Not, again indicating negation.</li>            <li><strong>sapta:</strong> Seven, referring to the seven creators or elements.</li>            <li><strong>dhātṛbhiḥ:</strong> Creators or sustainers, emphasizing the role of foundational elements in existence.</li>        </ul>    </li>        <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>In modern governance, leaders often rely on the support and trust of their constituents rather than just accolades.

It highlights the importance of reciprocity in relationships, whether in governance, business, or personal life. In essence, it teaches that the foundation of any successful endeavor lies in the collective effort and goodwill of those involved, making it applicable in various real-life scenarios where collaboration and mutual respect are essential for success.</li></ul>
