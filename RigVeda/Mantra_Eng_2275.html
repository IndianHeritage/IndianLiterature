        <ul>    <li><strong>tvaṁ viśveṣāṁ varuṇāsi rājā</strong>: This phrase translates to "You are the king of all beings, Varuna." Varuna is a deity associated with the cosmic order and moral authority. In real life, this can be seen as a reminder of the importance of leadership and responsibility in our communities. For example, a good leader in a company or a community acts as a guiding force, ensuring that everyone adheres to ethical standards.</li>        <li><strong>ye ca devā asura ye ca martāḥ</strong>: This means "both the gods and the demons, as well as mortals." This line highlights the coexistence of various forces in the universe, both positive and negative. In our daily lives, we encounter both good and bad influences. For instance, in a workplace, there may be colleagues who inspire and uplift us (the gods) and those who may create conflict or negativity (the demons). Recognizing this duality helps us navigate our interactions wisely.</li>        <li><strong>śataṁ no rāsva</strong>: This translates to "May we have a hundred (blessings)." The number 'hundred' symbolizes abundance and prosperity. In practical terms, this can relate to the aspirations we have in life, such as achieving success in our careers, building strong relationships, or attaining personal growth. Setting goals and striving for abundance in various aspects of life is a common pursuit.</li>        <li><strong>śarado vicakṣe</strong>: This means "with wisdom and discernment." It emphasizes the importance of making informed decisions. In real life, this can be applied to situations where we need to choose wisely, such as selecting a career path, making investments, or even in personal relationships. The ability to discern what is beneficial for us is crucial for our well-being.</li>        <li><strong>‘śyāmāyūṁṣi sudhitāni pūrvā</strong>: This translates to "the well-thought-out plans of the past." It suggests that the wisdom and experiences of our ancestors or previous generations can guide us. In modern life, we often rely on historical knowledge and lessons learned from past mistakes to inform our current decisions, whether in governance, education, or personal choices.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This mantra encapsulates the essence of leadership, the duality of existence, the pursuit of abundance, the importance of wisdom, and the value of historical knowledge. In real life, it serves as a guiding principle for individuals and communities to strive for ethical leadership, make informed choices, and learn from the past. By embodying these values, we can create a harmonious and prosperous society.</li></ul>
