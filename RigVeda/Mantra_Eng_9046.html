        <ul>    <li><strong>ino vājānām patir</strong>: This phrase translates to "the lord of the steeds." In the context of the Rigveda, "vājānām" refers to horses, which were symbols of power and wealth in ancient Indian society. The lord of the steeds signifies a protector or a leader who guides and supports his followers, much like a leader in modern times who inspires and motivates their team.</li>        <li><strong>inaḥ puṣṭīnāṁ sakhā</strong>: This means "the friend of nourishment." Here, "puṣṭīnāṁ" refers to nourishment or sustenance, and "sakhā" means friend. This can be interpreted as someone who provides support and resources for growth and well-being. In real life, this could relate to a mentor or a supportive friend who helps others thrive, similar to a teacher who nurtures students' potential.</li>        <li><strong>pra śmaśru haryato</strong>: This phrase can be understood as "the one who brings forth the golden light." "Śmaśru" refers to the beard or facial hair, often associated with wisdom and maturity, while "haryato" implies brightness or radiance. This can symbolize the wisdom that comes with experience, akin to a wise elder in a community who shares knowledge and guidance.</li>        <li><strong>dūdhod vi vṛthā yo adābhyaḥ</strong>: This translates to "who gives milk and is not in vain." "Dūdhod" refers to milk, a symbol of nourishment and sustenance, while "vṛthā" means in vain or without purpose. This part of the mantra emphasizes the importance of giving and sharing resources selflessly, much like a parent who nurtures their child with love and care, ensuring their growth and development.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra encapsulates themes of leadership, nourishment, wisdom, and selfless giving.
