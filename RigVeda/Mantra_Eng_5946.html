It highlights the cyclical nature of time and existence, suggesting that true knowledge is revealed through experience and contemplation, particularly during times of darkness or uncertainty. In real life, this can be applied to moments of personal reflection, learning from challenges, and recognizing the growth that comes from difficult experiences. Just as the rainy season brings renewal and fertility, our struggles can lead to profound insights and personal development. This mantra serves as a reminder to seek deeper understanding and wisdom in our lives, especially during challenging times.</p>
