        <ul>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "He who does not give to his friend, he is not a true friend. One who is not generous in friendship, he is not worthy of being called a friend." </li>    <li><strong>Word Breakdown:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>na sa sakhā:</strong> "He is not a friend"</li>            <li><strong>yo na dadāti:</strong> "who does not give"</li>            <li><strong>sakhye:</strong> "in friendship"</li>            <li><strong>sacābhuve:</strong> "in true friendship"</li>            <li><strong>pitvaḥ:</strong> "worthy of being called"</li>            <li><strong>apāsmāt:</strong> "from this"</li>            <li><strong>preyān:</strong> "beloved or dear one"</li>            <li><strong>na tad oko asti:</strong> "there is no such thing"</li>            <li><strong>pṛṇantam:</strong> "one who gives"</li>            <li><strong>anyam:</strong> "another"</li>            <li><strong>araṇaṁ:</strong> "refuge"</li>            <li><strong>cid icchet:</strong> "may desire"</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> This mantra emphasizes the importance of generosity and selflessness in friendships. It suggests that true friendship is characterized by the willingness to give and support one another. A friend who does not share or help in times of need is not a true friend. The mantra calls for a reflection on the nature of relationships and the responsibilities that come with them.</li>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>Friendship:</strong> In a close friendship, if one friend is going through a tough time, the other should be there to offer support, whether it be emotional, financial, or simply by being present. For instance, if a friend loses a job, a true friend would help them with job applications or provide moral support.</li>            <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> In a community setting, neighbors who help each other during difficult times, such as sharing food or resources during a crisis, exemplify the spirit of this mantra. For example, during natural disasters, communities often come together to support those affected, showcasing the essence of true friendship and generosity.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The significance of this mantra lies in its call for selflessness and generosity in relationships. It serves as a reminder that true friendship is not just about companionship but also about being there for one another in times of need. In real-life scenarios, this principle can be applied in personal relationships, community interactions, and even in professional settings where teamwork and collaboration are essential. By embodying the values expressed in this mantra, individuals can foster deeper, more meaningful connections with others, ultimately leading to a more compassionate and supportive society.</li></ul>
