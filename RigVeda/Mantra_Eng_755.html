        <ul>    <li><strong>Word Breakdown:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>Soma:</strong> Refers to a sacred drink in Vedic tradition, often associated with immortality and divine inspiration.</li>            <li><strong>Na:</strong> Means "not" or "no," indicating negation.</li>            <li><strong>Vedhā:</strong> Translates to "piercing" or "penetrating," often used in the context of knowledge or insight.</li>            <li><strong>Ṛtaprajāta:</strong> Refers to "born of truth" or "truthful," emphasizing the importance of righteousness and cosmic order.</li>            <li><strong>Paśur:</strong> Means "animal" or "creature," often symbolizing the material world or the physical body.</li>            <li><strong>Na:</strong> Again, means "not" or "no."</li>            <li><strong>Śiśvā:</strong> Refers to "suffering" or "pain," indicating challenges or obstacles.</li>            <li><strong>Vibhur:</strong> Means "all-pervading" or "omnipresent," suggesting a divine presence or universal consciousness.</li>            <li><strong>Dūrebhāḥ:</strong> Translates to "far away" or "distant," indicating something that is not easily accessible or attainable.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Meaning and Interpretation:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra speaks to the idea that true knowledge and insight (represented by Soma) are not easily attained through mere physical existence (Paśur).</li>            <li>It emphasizes that suffering (Śiśvā) is not inherent in the pursuit of truth (Ṛtaprajāta) but rather a part of the journey.</li>            <li>The omnipresence of the divine (Vibhur) suggests that while the truth may seem distant (Dūrebhāḥ), it is always within reach through sincere effort and understanding.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>In the pursuit of education, students often face challenges and obstacles (Śiśvā) that may deter them from seeking knowledge (Soma). However, these challenges are not the end but rather a part of the learning process.</li>            <li>In personal growth, individuals may encounter hardships that seem far away from their goals (Dūrebhāḥ). Yet, through perseverance and adherence to truth (Ṛtaprajāta), they can overcome these difficulties.</li>            <li>In spiritual practices, seekers may feel disconnected from divine knowledge (Vibhur) due to their material concerns (Paśur). This mantra reminds them that the path to enlightenment is not devoid of suffering but is enriched by it.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>        <ul>            <li>The mantra "somo na vedhā ṛtaprajātaḥ paśur na śiśvā vibhur dūrebhāḥ" serves as a profound reminder of the relationship between knowledge, suffering, and the pursuit of truth.</li>            <li>Its significance lies in encouraging individuals to embrace challenges as part of their journey towards understanding and enlightenment.</li>            <li>In real-life scenarios, this mantra can be applied in education, personal development, and spiritual practices, guiding individuals to seek truth and knowledge despite the obstacles they may face.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
