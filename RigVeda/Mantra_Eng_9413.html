It emphasizes the importance of following a moral and ethical path in life. In real life, this can be seen in individuals who choose to act with integrity, such as whistleblowers who expose wrongdoing despite potential personal consequences.</li>        <li><strong>na dakṣiṇā parāvṛṅ</strong>: This translates to "do not turn away from the right path." It serves as a reminder to stay committed to one's values and principles. For example, a student who resists peer pressure to cheat on an exam demonstrates this commitment to integrity.</li>        <li><strong>na tā nu me pṛśanyo jagṛbhre</strong>: This can be interpreted as "may they not take away my strength." This reflects the human desire to maintain one's power and agency. In a real-life context, this can relate to individuals who advocate for their rights and stand up against oppression, ensuring that their voices are heard.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra encapsulates themes of strength, wisdom, moral integrity, and the pursuit of righteousness.
