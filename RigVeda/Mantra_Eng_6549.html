        <ul>    <li><strong>tvaṁ hi supratūr asi</strong>: This phrase translates to "You are indeed the one who is well-guarded." Here, "tvaṁ" means "you," "hi" emphasizes the statement, and "supratūr" refers to being well-guarded or protected. In real life, this can be likened to the protective nature of a parent or guardian who ensures the safety and well-being of their children.</li>        <li><strong>tvaṁ no gomatīr iṣaḥ</strong>: This part means "You are our source of wealth." "Gomatīr" refers to wealth or prosperity, and "iṣaḥ" indicates a source or origin. This can be related to how individuals or communities rely on resources, such as land or skills, to generate wealth. For example, a farmer depends on fertile land to produce crops, which in turn provides sustenance and income.</li>        <li><strong>maho rāyaḥ sātim agne apā vṛdhi</strong>: This translates to "O Agni, may you grant us great prosperity and strength." "Maho" means great, "rāyaḥ" refers to prosperity, "sātim" means strength or stability, and "agne" is a reference to Agni, the fire god, who symbolizes energy and transformation. In a modern context, this can be seen in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation, where individuals or organizations seek to harness energy (both literal and metaphorical) to achieve success and growth.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This mantra emphasizes the importance of protection, wealth, and the pursuit of prosperity through strength and energy. It highlights the interconnectedness of these elements in achieving a fulfilling life.</li>        <li><strong>Real-life Application:</strong> In everyday life, this mantra can inspire individuals to seek protection and support from their community, to recognize the resources they have at their disposal, and to strive for personal and collective growth. For instance, in a business setting, leaders can draw on the principles of this mantra to foster a supportive environment that encourages innovation and collaboration, ultimately leading to greater success.</li></ul>
