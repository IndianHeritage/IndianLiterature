        <ul>    <li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "hastenaiva grāhya ādhir asyā brahmajāyeyam iti ced avocan | na dūtāya prahye tastha eṣā tathā rāṣṭraṁ gupitaṁ kṣatriyasya  ||"</li>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "This (knowledge) is to be grasped only by the hand; it is said to be born of Brahman. It is not for the messenger to take; it is thus protected by the Kshatriya (warrior class) for the state."</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Word-by-Word Explanation:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>hastenaiva:</strong> "only by the hand" - signifies the importance of direct action and personal involvement.</li>            <li><strong>grāhya:</strong> "to be grasped" - indicates that knowledge or truth must be actively pursued and understood.</li>            <li><strong>ādhir:</strong> "this" - refers to the knowledge or truth being discussed.</li>            <li><strong>asyā:</strong> "of this" - emphasizes the specific knowledge that is being referred to.</li>            <li><strong>brahmajāyeyam:</strong> "born of Brahman" - suggests that this knowledge is divine or sacred in nature.</li>            <li><strong>iti ced avocan:</strong> "it is said" - indicates that this is a widely accepted belief or teaching.</li>            <li><strong>na dūtāya:</strong> "not for the messenger" - implies that this knowledge is too profound to be conveyed by intermediaries.</li>            <li><strong>prahyet:</strong> "to take" - refers to the act of seizing or appropriating knowledge.</li>            <li><strong>tastha:</strong> "to stand" - indicates the permanence or stability of this knowledge.</li>            <li><strong>eṣā:</strong> "this" - again refers to the knowledge being discussed.</li>            <li><strong>tathā:</strong> "thus" - reinforces the previous statement about the nature of the knowledge.</li>            <li><strong>rāṣṭraṁ:</strong> "the state" - signifies the collective society or nation.</li>            <li><strong>gupitaṁ:</strong> "protected" - indicates that this knowledge is safeguarded.</li>            <li><strong>kṣatriyasya:</strong> "of the Kshatriya" - refers to the warrior class, responsible for protection and governance.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>The mantra emphasizes the importance of personal engagement in learning and understanding. For instance, in modern education, students are encouraged to actively participate in discussions and hands-on projects rather than passively receiving information.</li>            <li>The idea that knowledge is "born of Brahman" can be seen in various spiritual practices where individuals seek enlightenment through meditation and self-reflection, recognizing that true understanding comes from within.</li>            <li>The notion that knowledge should not be conveyed by messengers can be likened to the importance of mentorship, where direct guidance from an experienced individual is often more valuable than generic advice.</li>            <li>The protection of knowledge by the Kshatriya can be compared to how leaders and guardians in society (like educators, parents, and community leaders) play a crucial role in safeguarding and imparting wisdom to future generations.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra highlights the significance of direct engagement with knowledge and the sacredness of understanding that knowledge is divine in nature.</li>            <li>It teaches us that true wisdom cannot be merely passed along; it must be grasped and protected by those who are responsible for the well-being of society.</li>            <li>In real life, this mantra encourages individuals to take an active role in their learning and to value the wisdom that is passed down through direct experience and mentorship.</li>            <li>Ultimately, it serves as a reminder of the responsibilities that come with knowledge and the importance of safeguarding it for the benefit of the community.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
