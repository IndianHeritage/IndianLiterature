        <ul>    <li><strong>mā no hetir vivasvata ādityāḥ</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "May the sun (Āditya) not be our enemy." Here, "mā" means "not," "no" refers to "our," "hetir" means "enemy," and "vivasvata" refers to the sun or the radiant one. The sun is often seen as a source of life and energy, and in this context, it symbolizes positivity and strength.</li>        <li><strong>kṛtrimā śaruḥ</strong>: This part translates to "may the artificial (or man-made) be removed." "Kṛtrimā" means "artificial" or "not natural," and "śaruḥ" can be interpreted as "removal" or "destruction." This suggests a desire to eliminate falsehoods or artificial constructs that may hinder our progress or well-being.</li>        <li><strong>purā nu jaraso vadhīt</strong>: This translates to "may the old age (jarasa) not kill us." "Purā" means "formerly" or "in the past," "nu" is an expression of hope or desire, and "vadhīt" means "to kill" or "to destroy." This line expresses a wish to overcome the limitations and decay associated with aging, emphasizing the importance of vitality and youthfulness.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>In modern life, the sun can be seen as a metaphor for positivity and energy.
