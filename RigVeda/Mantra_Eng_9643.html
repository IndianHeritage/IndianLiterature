        <ul>    <li><strong>yā te dhāmāni paramāṇi</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "those who are your supreme abode." Here, "dhāmāni" refers to the realms or places of existence, and "paramāṇi" signifies the ultimate or supreme.

"Tanvaṁ" refers to the body, and "vṛdhānaḥ" signifies growth or development. This can be interpreted as the importance of self-care and personal development. In real life, this could manifest as individuals engaging in physical fitness, meditation, or other practices that promote holistic well-being.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra emphasizes the significance of seeking higher truths, maintaining balance, being present in our actions, sharing knowledge, and nurturing personal growth.
