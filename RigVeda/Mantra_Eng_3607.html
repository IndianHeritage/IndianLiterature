        <ul>    <li><strong>pra ye dhāmāni pūrvyāṇy</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "those who have established the ancient abodes." Here, "dhāmāni" refers to the realms or abodes, and "pūrvyāṇy" indicates the ancient or primordial nature of these places. In real life, this can be likened to the foundational values and traditions that shape our societies, such as family, culture, and heritage.</li>        <li><strong>arcān vi yad ucchān</strong>: This translates to "those who perform the rituals and offerings." "Arcān" refers to worship or rituals, and "ucchān" implies the act of elevating or raising. This can be seen in modern life through various religious practices where individuals or communities come together to perform rituals, such as Diwali celebrations in Hindu culture, where offerings are made to deities to seek blessings.</li>        <li><strong>viyotāro amūrāḥ</strong>: This means "the shining ones who are immortal." "Viyotāro" refers to those who shine or illuminate, and "amūrāḥ" indicates immortality.

"Ajasrā" indicates eternity, "ṛtadhītayo" refers to those who understand the truth, and "rurucanta" means to shine or radiate. In a real-life context, this can be associated with individuals who seek knowledge and truth, such as scientists or philosophers who contribute to our understanding of the universe and human existence.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra emphasizes the importance of ancient wisdom, rituals, and the role of creators and truth-seekers in our lives. It signifies that our foundations are built upon the values and traditions passed down through generations, and that the pursuit of knowledge and truth is a continuous journey.
