        <ul>    <li><strong>uta prahām atidīvyā</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "may we be blessed with divine strength." The term "prahām" refers to strength or power, while "atidīvyā" signifies something that is beyond the ordinary, divine in nature.</li>    <li><strong>jayāti kṛtaṁ yac chvaghnī</strong>: This part means "victory comes to those who act with determination." Here, "jayāti" signifies victory, "kṛtaṁ" refers to actions or deeds, and "chvaghnī" can be interpreted as a metaphor for the fire of determination that burns within us.</li>    <li><strong>vicinoti kāle</strong>: This translates to "who knows the right time." "Vicinoti" means to discern or recognize, and "kāle" refers to time. This emphasizes the importance of timing in our actions.</li>    <li><strong>yo devakāmo na dhanā ruṇaddhi</strong>: This means "who desires divine blessings rather than material wealth." "Devakāmo" refers to one who seeks divine or spiritual fulfillment, while "dhanā" means wealth, and "ruṇaddhi" implies being entangled or caught up in material pursuits.</li>    <li><strong>sam it taṁ rāyā sṛjati svadhāvān</strong>: This translates to "such a person creates their own prosperity." "Sam it" means 'thus' or 'in this way', "rāyā" refers to prosperity or abundance, and "sṛjati svadhāvān" means to create or manifest through one's own efforts.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This mantra from the Rigveda emphasizes the significance of divine strength, determination, and the right timing in achieving success. It teaches us that true prosperity comes not from the pursuit of material wealth but from seeking spiritual fulfillment and acting with purpose. In real life, this can be applied in various scenarios, such as in career choices, personal development, and relationships. For instance, an individual who focuses on their passions and seeks to contribute positively to society, rather than merely chasing financial gain, is likely to find deeper satisfaction and success. This mantra serves as a reminder to align our actions with our higher values and to trust in the divine timing of our endeavors.</p>
