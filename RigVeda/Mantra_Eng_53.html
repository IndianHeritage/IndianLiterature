        <ul>    <li><strong>Word-by-Word Meaning:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>ketuṁ:</strong> A flag or banner, symbolizing victory or a guiding principle.</li>            <li><strong>kṛṇvann:</strong> Creating or establishing.</li>            <li><strong>aketave:</strong> Without a flag or banner, indicating a state of confusion or lack of direction.</li>            <li><strong>peśo:</strong> Of the body or physical form.</li>            <li><strong>maryā:</strong> A boundary or limit, often referring to the moral or ethical limits.</li>            <li><strong>apeśase:</strong> Without boundaries or limits, suggesting freedom or transcendence.</li>            <li><strong>sam:</strong> Together or in harmony.</li>            <li><strong>uṣadbhir:</strong> With herbs or plants, often symbolizing nourishment or healing.</li>            <li><strong>ajāyathāḥ:</strong> You were born or came into being.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra speaks to the duality of existence, contrasting the idea of having a guiding principle (ketuṁ) with the state of being lost or directionless (aketave).</li>            <li>The mention of "maryā" and "apeśase" highlights the importance of boundaries in life, suggesting that while we seek freedom, we must also respect certain limits that define our moral and ethical existence.</li>            <li>The phrase "sam uṣadbhir ajāyathāḥ" emphasizes the interconnectedness of life, suggesting that we are nourished and sustained by nature (herbs and plants) and that our existence is a collective experience.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>In a corporate setting, a company may have a clear vision (ketuṁ) that guides its operations. However, without this guiding principle, employees may feel lost (aketave) and unsure of their roles.</li>            <li>In personal relationships, setting boundaries (maryā) is crucial for healthy interactions. While we may desire freedom (apeśase), understanding and respecting limits can lead to more fulfilling connections.</li>            <li>In environmental conservation, recognizing our dependence on nature (uṣadbhir) is vital. Our well-being is intertwined with the health of our ecosystems, and we must work together (sam) to protect them.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra serves as a reminder of the balance between guidance and freedom, the importance of boundaries, and our connection to nature.</li>            <li>In real life, it encourages us to seek clarity in our goals, respect ethical limits, and acknowledge our interdependence with the environment and each other.</li>            <li>By embodying these principles, we can navigate life's complexities with purpose and harmony.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
