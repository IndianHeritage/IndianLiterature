        <ul>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> The mantra speaks about the presence of rulers (rājānaṁ) and the people (janānām) who dwell in the world (vasatiṁ). It emphasizes that those who are unworthy (arātayo) do not have a place among mortals (martyeṣu). It calls upon the divine (brahmāṇy) to create (sṛjantu) a situation where those who are criticized (ninditāro) become unworthy (nindyāso).</li>        <li><strong>Meaning of Key Terms:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>Vasāṁ:</strong> Refers to the essence or presence.</li>            <li><strong>Rājānaṁ:</strong> Kings or rulers, symbolizing authority and governance.</li>            <li><strong>Janānām:</strong> The people or the populace, representing society.</li>            <li><strong>Arātayo:</strong> Those who are unworthy or undeserving.</li>            <li><strong>Martyeṣu:</strong> Among mortals, indicating the human realm.</li>            <li><strong>Brahmāṇy:</strong> Pertaining to the divine or the ultimate reality.</li>            <li><strong>Sṛjantu:</strong> To create or manifest.</li>            <li><strong>Ninditāro:</strong> Those who are criticized or condemned.</li>            <li><strong>Nindyāso:</strong> Those who are unworthy of respect or honor.</li>        </ul>    </li>        <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>In a democratic society, the mantra can be seen as a call for accountability among leaders. For instance, when political leaders engage in corruption, the public (janānām) often demands their removal, reflecting the idea that unworthy rulers (arātayo) should not hold power among mortals (martyeṣu).</li>            <li>In the corporate world, this mantra can apply to leadership ethics. Companies that prioritize integrity and transparency tend to thrive, while those led by unworthy individuals face criticism and potential failure.</li>            <li>In community settings, this mantra encourages the idea that leaders should be held to high standards. For example, community leaders who fail to serve their constituents effectively may be called out and replaced, aligning with the notion of creating a just society.</li>        </ul>    </li>        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This mantra serves as a reminder of the importance of righteous leadership and the role of the divine in shaping society. It emphasizes that unworthy individuals should not occupy positions of power, and it calls for the creation of a just environment where leaders are held accountable. In real life, this principle is applicable in governance, corporate ethics, and community leadership, urging individuals to strive for integrity and responsibility in their roles.</li></ul>
