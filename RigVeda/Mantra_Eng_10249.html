It emphasizes the power of words and communication. In contemporary society, this can be reflected in the impact of social media and how our words can influence others, for better or worse. For example, a single tweet can spark a global movement.</li>        <li><strong>yad devā devam ayajanta viśve</strong>: This translates to "What did the gods worship, the all-encompassing?" It highlights the universal search for the divine or the higher power. In real life, this can be seen in the various forms of worship and spirituality across cultures, where people seek connection with something greater than themselves, whether through religion, nature, or community.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra from the Rigveda invites us to ponder fundamental questions about existence, boundaries, communication, and the divine.
