        <ul>    <li><strong>Durmantv atrāmṛtasya nāma salakṣmā</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "the name of the one who is the essence of immortality and has auspiciousness." Here, "durmantv" refers to the essence or nature of something that is eternal, while "salakṣmā" signifies prosperity and auspiciousness. In real life, this can be related to the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, which are often seen as pathways to achieving a prosperous and fulfilling life.</li>        <li><strong>Yad viṣurūpā bhavāti</strong>: This translates to "that which takes on various forms." This can be interpreted as the adaptability and versatility of life. For example, in nature, we see how a river can change its course, adapting to the landscape. Similarly, in our lives, we often need to adapt to changing circumstances, whether in our careers or personal relationships.</li>        <li><strong>Yamasya yo manavate</strong>: This means "whoever contemplates the essence of Yama." Yama, in Hindu philosophy, represents the moral and ethical dimensions of life, including concepts like truth, non-violence, and self-discipline. In a real-life context, this can be seen in the practice of yoga and meditation, where individuals reflect on their actions and strive for a balanced and ethical life.</li>        <li><strong>Sumantv agne</strong>: This phrase translates to "may the fire (Agni) be favorable." Agni symbolizes energy, transformation, and the divine spark within us. In practical terms, this can relate to the importance of passion and motivation in achieving our goals. For instance, a person pursuing a career in the arts may draw inspiration from their inner fire to create meaningful work.</li>        <li><strong>Tam ṛṣva pāhy aprayucchan</strong>: This can be interpreted as "may that energy protect us and not abandon us." This signifies the need for protection and guidance in our endeavors. In everyday life, this can be seen in the support we seek from mentors, friends, or family as we navigate challenges and strive for success.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra emphasizes the importance of seeking immortality through wisdom, adaptability, ethical contemplation, passion, and protection. In real life, these principles can guide individuals in their personal and professional journeys, encouraging them to remain resilient and focused on their goals while fostering a sense of community and support. By embodying these values, one can lead a more meaningful and prosperous life, ultimately contributing to the well-being of society as a whole.</p>
