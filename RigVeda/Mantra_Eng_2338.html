This can be related to the pursuit of truth and integrity in our lives. In real life, this is applicable in various fields, such as journalism, where the commitment to truth is essential for credibility and trustworthiness.</li>        <li><strong>Stutas tvam bheṣajā rāsy asme</strong>: This means "we praise you, the source of healing." This highlights the importance of health and well-being. In today's world, this can be seen in the emphasis on holistic health practices, such as yoga and meditation, which promote physical and mental wellness.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra emphasizes respect for parents, the importance of nature, the pursuit of truth, and the significance of healing.
