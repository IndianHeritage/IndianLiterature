Here, "stomā" refers to hymns or praises, while "āsan" means to be seated or established. This suggests that the essence of these hymns resides within us, indicating the importance of internalizing spiritual teachings.</li>        <li><strong>kurīraṁ chanda opaśaḥ</strong>: This part can be interpreted as "the song of the seer is a source of inspiration."
