        <ul>    <li><strong>mā kasmai dhātam abhy amitriṇe</strong>: This phrase can be translated as "Do not give to anyone who is hostile." It emphasizes the importance of not sharing resources or blessings with those who harbor ill intentions. In real life, this can be seen in relationships where trust is paramount; for instance, one should be cautious in sharing personal information with someone who has previously shown betrayal.</li>        <li><strong>no mākutrā no gṛhebhyo</strong>: This translates to "Let there be no harm from our homes." It signifies the desire for safety and protection within one's household. In practical terms, this can relate to the importance of creating a secure environment for families, such as ensuring that homes are safe from external threats, whether they be physical dangers or negative influences.</li>        <li><strong>dhenavo guḥ</strong>: This means "the cows are hidden." Cows in Vedic culture symbolize wealth, nourishment, and prosperity. The phrase suggests that true wealth may not always be visible or apparent. In modern life, this can be likened to the idea that true value often lies beneath the surface, such as in relationships or personal growth, which may not be immediately recognized.</li>        <li><strong>stanābhujo aśiśvīḥ</strong>: This can be interpreted as "those who are nourished by the breast." It refers to the nurturing aspect of life, highlighting the importance of care and sustenance. In real life, this can be seen in the role of caregivers, parents, and communities that provide support and nourishment to individuals, especially children and the vulnerable.</li></ul><br><ul>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra encapsulates the essence of protection, discernment in relationships, and the value of nurturing. Its significance lies in the reminder to be mindful of whom we share our resources with, to prioritize the safety of our homes, and to recognize the hidden wealth in our lives. In a world where trust and safety are often challenged, this mantra serves as a guiding principle for fostering healthy relationships and communities, ensuring that we cultivate environments that are supportive and protective.</li></ul>
