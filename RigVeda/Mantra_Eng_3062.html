It highlights the importance of wisdom in achieving immortality, not in a literal sense, but in leaving a lasting legacy. For instance, scientists and thinkers who contribute to knowledge and society create an "immortal" impact through their work.</li>        <li><strong>dyauṣ pitā janitā satyam ukṣan</strong>: This translates to "the sky (heaven) is the father, giving birth to truth." This line emphasizes the connection between the divine and the truth.
