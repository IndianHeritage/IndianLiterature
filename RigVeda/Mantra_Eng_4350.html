        <ul>    <li><strong>imām ū ṣv āsurasya śrutasya mahīm</strong>: This phrase can be translated to "I speak of the great glory of the divine, the one who is known and revered." Here, "imām" refers to "this," "ū" means "I," "ṣv" relates to "speak," "āsurasya" refers to "of the divine," "śrutasya" means "known," and "mahīm" signifies "greatness" or "glory." This emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and speaking about the divine qualities that inspire reverence.</li>        <li><strong>māyāṁ varuṇasya pra vocam</strong>: This translates to "I declare the illusion of Varuna." "Māyāṁ" refers to "illusion" or "the cosmic illusion," "varuṇasya" means "of Varuna," who is the god of water and cosmic order, and "pra vocam" means "I declare."

"Māneneva" means "by respect," "tasthivām̐" refers to "I stand," and "antarikṣe" means "in the space" or "in the atmosphere." This indicates that respect and reverence for the divine allow one to find their place in the universe.</li>        <li><strong>vi yo mame pṛthivīṁ sūryeṇa</strong>: This translates to "Whoever has the earth with the sun." "Vi" means "who," "yo" refers to "whoever," "mame" means "my," "pṛthivīṁ" refers to "earth," and "sūryeṇa" means "with the sun." This line emphasizes the interconnectedness of the earth and the sun, symbolizing the relationship between the material and spiritual worlds.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This mantra from the Rigveda highlights the significance of recognizing the divine presence in our lives and the importance of respect and reverence towards it.
