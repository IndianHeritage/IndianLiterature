It acknowledges the presence of challenges or opposition in life. For example, in a competitive work environment, colleagues may be seen as adversaries, but this can also lead to personal growth and improvement.</li>        <li><strong>Sahāvahai:</strong> This translates to "may we unite." It emphasizes the importance of unity and collaboration.
