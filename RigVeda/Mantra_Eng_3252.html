        <ul>    <li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "asiknyāṁ yajamāno na hotā"</li>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> This mantra can be translated to mean "The one who does not perform the sacrifice (yajna) is not a true priest (hotā)." </li>    <li><strong>Word Breakdown:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>Asiknyāṁ:</strong> Refers to the act of performing a sacrifice or yajna.</li>            <li><strong>Yajamāno:</strong> Indicates the one who is performing the yajna or sacrifice.</li>            <li><strong>Na:</strong> Means "not" or "without."</li>            <li><strong>Hotā:</strong> Refers to the priest or the one who officiates the sacrifice.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Contextual Meaning:</strong>         <ul>            <li>This mantra emphasizes the importance of active participation in rituals and duties. It suggests that merely holding the title of a priest or a leader is insufficient without the corresponding actions that validate that role.</li>            <li>In a broader sense, it can be interpreted as a call to action, urging individuals to engage in their responsibilities rather than just assume roles without fulfilling their duties.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong>        <ul>            <li>In a workplace, a manager who does not actively lead or support their team may be seen as ineffective, despite their title. This aligns with the idea that true leadership requires action.</li>            <li>In community service, a person who claims to be a volunteer but does not participate in activities or help others is not fulfilling the essence of being a volunteer.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>        <ul>            <li>The significance of this mantra lies in its reminder that titles and roles come with responsibilities that must be actively fulfilled. It encourages individuals to embody their roles through action.</li>            <li>In real life, this principle can be applied in various contexts, such as leadership, community involvement, and personal relationships, where active participation and commitment are essential for true effectiveness and respect.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
