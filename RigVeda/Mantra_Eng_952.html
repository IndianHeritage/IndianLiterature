        <ul>    <li><strong>Mantra:</strong> "pūrvībhir hi dadāśima śaradbhir maruto vayam | avobhiś carṣaṇīnām ||"</li>    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "We, the Maruts, have been endowed with the strength of the earlier ones; we are the ones who move with the winds."</li>    <li><strong>Word Breakdown:</strong>        <ul>            <li><strong>pūrvībhir:</strong> from the earlier ones, indicating a connection to past generations or forces.</li>            <li><strong>hi:</strong> indeed, emphasizing the statement.</li>            <li><strong>dadāśima:</strong> we have been endowed or given, suggesting a gift or blessing.</li>            <li><strong>śaradbhir:</strong> with the strength or power, often associated with the seasons or cycles.</li>            <li><strong>maruto:</strong> referring to the Maruts, the storm deities or winds in Vedic literature.</li>            <li><strong>vayam:</strong> we, indicating a collective identity.</li>            <li><strong>avobhiś:</strong> we move or we are carried, suggesting action or dynamism.</li>            <li><strong>carṣaṇīnām:</strong> of the winds or the moving forces, indicating a connection to nature.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra speaks to the idea of inheriting strength and wisdom from those who came before us. Just as the Maruts, the storm gods, draw power from the winds, we too can draw upon the knowledge and experiences of our ancestors.</li>            <li>In real life, this can be seen in various contexts, such as in family traditions where wisdom is passed down through generations. For example, a grandparent may share life lessons with their grandchildren, empowering them to face challenges with the strength of their lineage.</li>            <li>The reference to moving with the winds can symbolize adaptability and resilience. In a rapidly changing world, individuals and communities must learn to navigate challenges, much like the Maruts who embody the forces of nature.</li>        </ul>    </li>    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>        <ul>            <li>This mantra highlights the significance of heritage and the importance of learning from the past. It encourages us to recognize the strength we inherit from those who came before us and to use that strength to navigate our own paths.</li>            <li>In practical terms, this can be applied in various aspects of life, such as in education, where students can benefit from the knowledge of their teachers and predecessors, or in community building, where shared histories can foster unity and resilience.</li>            <li>Ultimately, the mantra serves as a reminder that we are part of a larger continuum, and by acknowledging our roots, we can harness the power of our collective experiences to face the future with confidence.</li>        </ul>    </li></ul>
