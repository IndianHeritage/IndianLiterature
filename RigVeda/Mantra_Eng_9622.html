It emphasizes the importance of wisdom and collective knowledge in a community. In modern society, this can be reflected in collaborative efforts, such as community projects or educational initiatives, where shared wisdom leads to better outcomes for all.</li>        <li><strong>na yāmann uta tviṣā</strong>: This translates to "not for anyone's glory." It suggests that actions should not be motivated by personal gain or recognition. In real life, this can be seen in selfless acts of service, where individuals contribute to society without seeking fame or reward.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mantra emphasizes the importance of using power wisely, nurturing the environment, acting with integrity, embracing responsibility, valuing collective wisdom, and performing selfless acts. Its significance lies in guiding individuals and communities towards a harmonious existence, where actions are taken for the greater good rather than personal gain.
